\section{An imperative to engage}\label{sec:litspi}

A dominant conceptualisation of the interactions of science and public policy is the \glsxtrlong{spi} (\SPI; \cite{JagannathanEtAl2023}). This interface represents the institutions and mechanisms by which knowledge is transferred between the processes of scientific enquiry and public policy decisionmaking. In its traditional form, \emph{the rational model}, evidence derived from scientific enquiry is used to inform policy decisions and thus science is often considered to \emph{supply} knowledge in response to \emph{demand} from policy. In reality, the \SPI{} a ``complicated and erratic flow of information'' (\cite{BednarekSHG2015}) that is constantly evolving with changing values, demands and understanding of science, policy and society (\cite{Obermeister2020}). Yet, despite being ``widely debunked'' (\cite{BoswellS2017}, also \cite{McNie2007,HaynesDCRHGS2011,Cairney2018}), the rational supply-demand model persists implicitly in much literature about the \SPI, resulting in normative guidance for scientists to align their actions better with the needs of policy (e.g. \cite{McNie2007,GeddesDP2018,BlessenohlS2022,Bisbal2024}).

Such guidances, and their underlying research and discussion, are well-intended efforts to close the ``gap'' that is widely recognised between science knowledge and policy goals (e.g. \cite{RapleyD2014,KarlssonG2020,CairneyTS2023}). Some of the greatest consequences of this gap is the delay in policy, and thus action, related to the \glsxtrlong{can} (\CAN) crises. These intersecting crises of a destabilising climate (\cite{IIPCC2022}) and deteriorating nature (\cite{IPBES2022}) and are already threatening and undermining the lives and livelihoods of people in a myriad of guises (\cite{TschakertEAKO2019}) and the implications for humanity as a whole are serious (\cite{McKayEtAl2022,WEF2024}). There is now little dispute that societal transformation is necessary to avoid catastrophic impacts of the \CAN{} crises (\cite{LaybournTS2023}). Yet, while policymakers have changed their perspectives on these issues a great deal, there has been a failure recognise and respond to the unstructured and emergent nature of \CAN{} issues (\cite{FuntowiczR1993,WesselinkH2020}), which instead are ``tacked onto how they always thought about the economy'' (\cite[p118]{Killick2023}). The gap here is lack of policy that is commensurate with the scale and urgency of the \CAN{} crises. Rather than construing the gap as an issue of the misalignment of scientists to policy, the implication is that it is a misalignment of the \SPI{} to the \CAN{} crises.

Under such an observation, normative instructions to scientists about how to act are somewhat incongruous. Yet, the evidence is that scientists are not confident about engaging with policy (\cite{KEU2021perceptions}), despite their input being recognised at ``vital'' (\cite{KennyRHTB2017}). This has not gone unnoticed, \SPI{} boundary organisations have been established worldwide. For instance the \href{https://www.ipcc.ch/}{Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change} (\IPCC) and the \href{https://www.ipbes.net/}{Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services} (\IPBES) are international organisations tasked with establishing policy-relevant science, drawing on wider knowledges and values (e.g. \cite{PascualEtAl2018,MatukBSAHT2020})  and producing the policy advice. Policy itself is made nationally and locally, requiring the relevant knowledge to be convened in these contexts. In the UK, the \href{https://www.theccc.org.uk/}{Climate Change Committee} (\CCC) is the independent statutory body for advising the UK and devolved governments on climate-related policy and the \href{https://jncc.gov.uk/}{Joint Nature Conservation Committee} (\JNCC) is the statutory nature adviser for UK and devolved governments. Scientists are essential to these boundary organisations. They also continue to be invited to engage directly with governmental policymaking functions, by whom a range of documents have been produced that define and describe principles and practices of science-policy intermediation (e.g. \cite{OECD2015,DottiACDMPSVW2024,KarkkainenLKK2024}). 

\section{Roles at the science-policy interface}\label{sec:litroles}

Many researchers studying the processes, practices and pathways by which knowledge meaningfully informs action, consider that \SPI s need intermediaries between scientists and policymakers (\cite{JagannathanEtAl2023}). A number of boundary-spanning roles are defined within the theoretical and empirical literature and these are summarised in this section. These roles embody different values, objectives and strategies for knowledge creation and exchange with policymaking. The work of Roger A. Pielke, Jr. has been highly influential in describing an idealised set of roles at the \SPI: \emph{Pure Scientist}, \emph{Science Arbiter}, \emph{Issue Advocate} and \emph{Honest Broker of Policy Alternatives} (\cite{Pielke2007}). This set of roles has been developed both in theory and empirically over recent years. This section also includes a summary of a further role, the \emph{Policy Entrepreneur}, probably the best known policy intermediary, although not necessarily one that interfaces with science.

\subsection{Pure Scientist}
The \emph{Pure Scientist} is a ``knowledge generator'' (\cite{BalvaneraJNOBCDGGKKMPSSW2020}) who's interest is solely in sharing information (\cite{Pielke2007}) with no consideration for its use (\cite{RapleyD2014}). \textcite{SteelLLS2004} and \textcite{SinghTKMMC2014} find scientists working in policy-relevant environmental and social science fields who engaged only in reporting science such as by publishing their findings or presenting their work at conferences.

\subsection{Science Communicator}
Recognising the policy-importance of engagement with the public, \textcite{RapleyD2014} added \emph{Science Communicator} to the set of policy-relevant science roles. This role interprets the science and draws attention to the implications. \textcite{SteelLLS2004} and \textcite{SinghTKMMC2014} identified an \emph{Interpreting} scientists who interpret science for the public without taking a policy position, such as by publishing in the popular media or being interviewed by a journalist.

\subsection{Science Arbiter}
\textcite{Pielke2007} envisaged the \emph{Science Arbiter} as a resource for the decision-maker, ``standing ready to answer factual questions that the decision-maker thinks are relevant''. \textcite{GluckmanBK2021} describes this as a technocratic role, often performed by a team, focused on explicitly answering policymakers' questions. The science arbiter, does not express a position on policy, sticking instead to the scientific facts (\cite{RapleyD2014}). In their recent publication, the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters define a similar role, the \emph{Synthesiser}, who communicates existing, policy-relevant research findings (\cite{KarkkainenLKK2024}). However, empirical evidence of the \emph{Science Arbiter} is less prevalent, perhaps because this role merges with the better understood \emph{Science Adviser}.

\subsection{Science Adviser}
\textcite{Pielke2007} did not define the \emph{Science Adviser} but this role is well understood within policy settings. This role is not an ideal type, but rather describes the real-world experience of scientists called on to synthesise the existing science - much as the \emph{Science Arbiter} - but also to interpret this for the policy context and thus is another \emph{Interpreting} role (\cite{SteelLLS2004,SinghTKMMC2014}). In his thorough study of \emph{Science Adviser}s, \textcite{Obermeister2020} describes how this role is a process of learning and becoming increasingly expert, not so much in the science but in navigating the tensions of science advice in the contexts in which they advise. Through this learning process, \emph{Science Adviser}s become \emph{Knowledge Broker}s (\cite{Obermeister2020,GluckmanBK2021}).

\subsection{Knowledge Broker}
As well as synthesis, the \emph{Knowledge Broker} translates knowledge to the given setting, communicates it across disciplines (\cite{GogginEtAl2015}) contributing their own expertise (\cite{RapleyD2014}), including in knowledges other than those of science and policy (\cite{Gluckman2014}). \textcite{KarkkainenLKK2024} offer the \emph{Commentator} role which applies research findings to provide expert opinions. In the \SPI{} setting, \textcite{Pielke2007} defined the \emph{Honest Broker of Policy Alternatives} to emphasise the importance of the scientist's credibility and the science's legitimacy (\cite{DuncanRE2020}). In Pielke's depiction, a necessary [action] of the \emph{Honest Broker of Policy Alternatives} is to ``expand (or at least clarify) the scope of choice for decision-making'', based on the policymaker's preferences and values and ``in a way that allows for the decision-maker to reduce choice''\improvement{check the quotes and get the page number for this pielke citation}. In particular, this supports policymakers when the science is inevitably incomplete and ``put personal biases and values aside in order to assist policymakers in making choices between options'' (\cite{GluckmanBK2021}). \textcite{SteelLLS2004,SinghTKMMC2014} identify the \emph{Integrating} role in real-world settings that includes collaboration with policymakers to integrate science without taking a policy position and \textcite{BednarekSHG2015} describe observing expert science-policy intermediaries refraining from advocating a particular position.

, this role is a \emph{Commentator} (\cite{KarkkainenLKK2024})

\subsection{issue advocate}
\cite{Pielke2007} - Issue Advocate - makes the case for one alternative over others
\cite{GregoryBW2024} - Pielke ``comes armed from their own analysis and value set with a preferred view and focuses on the implementation of that specific policy option, rather than offering a range of different options. They act to limit choices''
\cite{GluckmanBK2021} - issue advocate ``not generally appropriate as an institutionalized boundary function ... pursue a special agenda''
\cite{BalvaneraJNOBCDGGKKMPSSW2020} - advocating for a particular cause
\cite{ElsensohnACDGGKPRS2019} - argues for scientists to ``highlight the importance of governmental funding for basic, translational, and applied research''
\cite{KalafatisL2019} - in a graphical survey of scientists, identified 5 models of how scientists perceived their potential roles in science-policy diffusion process. Two of these (the Beacon Model and Outcast Model) could be translated as successful and unsuccessful issue advocates, highlighting .
\cite{RapleyD2014} - Issue advocate - engages with decision makers and public to promote a particular course of action, based on expert knowledge - Some see impartiality compromised by issue advocate role, others ``argue that a climate scientist's specialist knowledge, acquired at the taxpayers' expense, constitutes an obligation to speak out''
\cite{KarkkainenLKK2024} - Advocate - Utilising research in issue advocacy
\cite{Gluckman2014} - when advice is perceived as advocacy, trust in the advice is undermined
\cite{RykielEtAl2002} - scientists can have a range of relationships to advocacy, depending on their values: 1. science and activism are incompatible; 2. advocating for science in general and the essential nature of scientific contribution; 3. personal and professional values influence the selection of topics, method and application; 4. respect for objectivity does not free scientist from citizenship obligations

\subsection{policy advocate}
\cite{ScottRLPAFSRSS2007} - policy advocacy (``support of a particular policy or class of policies'') is present in almost all of 270 papers reviewed from journals that emphasized application of science to conservation and management - majority of survey respondents also felt papers advocated for policy preferences, and most considered that this should be included
\cite{SteelLLS2004,SinghTKMMC2014} - Taking a position - actively supporting a position on a particular issue based on scientific results (eg participating in an organized campaign, writing op-eds, contacting politicians to voice opinions, speaking at rallies or protests).
\cite{SteelLLS2004} - emerging ``integrative'' model of the role of science and scientists in the policy process (also called ``post-normal science'') ``suggests that scientists should not hesitate to make judgments that favor certain management alternatives, if the preponderance of evidence and their own experience and judgment moves them in certain practical directions. They are, after all, in the best position to interpret the scientific data and findings and thus are in a special position to advocate for specific management policies and alternatives''
\cite{DablanderSCSBGGBAH2024} - Survey 9,220 scientists across different fields and careers to understand their attitudes to advocacy and protest: 29\% of respondents already engage in climate change advocacy [policy advocacy] and 51\% believed that scientists should engage more in advocacy
\cite{WyattGT2024} - arguments that knowing and not acting is more damaging to credibility than being an advocate

\subsection{honest advocate version of policy advocate}
\cite{GregoryBW2024} - question whether it is enough for scientists to be detached `honest brokers' in policy formation and suggest honest advocate
\cite{RoseBOP2018} - find a particular rigorous review of science and its consequential use of framing, clear language and window of opportunity to be a honest advocate

\subsection{policy entrepreneur}
\cite{vonMalmborg2024strategies} - \glsxtrlong{pe} (\PE) role ``introduced by Robert A. Dahl in the 1960s and popularized by John W. Kingdon in the 1980s''
\cite{Cairney2018} - policy entrepreneur
\cite{AukesLB2018} - interpretive policy entrepreneur (IPE)
\cite{CarterC2018} - FOE as PE
\cite{MintromL2017} - studies two policy entrepreneurs in climate policy
\cite{MintromL2017} - two case studies of climate change PEs
\cite{Green2017} - suggests that PEs will be necessary to for the implementation and scaling up of climate policy

\cite{MacKillopCDD2023} - in KBOs: ``PEs, and to some extent PBs, assist decision-makers by helping them privilege particular ('credible') framings of policy problems and solutions''
\cite{vonMalmborg2024transport} - discover two policy entrepreneurs in EU negotiations around decarbonisation of maritime transport
\cite{vonMalmborg2024strategies} - ``policy entrepreneurs do not only impact agenda-setting, policy preferences, and policies and their outcomes, but also procedures and normative principles of liberal and deliberative democratic governance---positively or negatively, intentionally or unintentionally.''

This is probably one of the more discussed and studied policy roles owing to perception of policy influence. This influence is achieved using strategies that may directly [clash with scientific principles] and thus tends not to be a recommended role for scientists. However, the presence of the \PE has been studied in \CAN policy settings (e.g. \cite{MintromL2017,CarterC2018}  the strategies attributed to \PE s are often relevant to other \SPI roles, and their presence within policy settings, makes this role   indeed there has been recent criticism of many of the earlier work

\emph{theory and observation of roles played between science and policy - this is the core of the literature because I am aiming to understand what are the roles that could be, should be and are played, their benefits and trade-offs, and how scientists specifically inhabit these roles}\\
key theories from policy studies (e.g. Policy Entrepreneur, Problem Broker, Pielke's roles)\\
characteristics exhibited in each role\\
conflicts between philosophical position of scientists and roles proposed at interface\\
studies identifying the roles played by scientists at the interface

, \textcite{Pielke2007}, defined four idealised roles for scientists at the interface: \emph{pure scientist} - unconcerned by policy; \emph{science arbiter} - answers questions posed by policy; \emph{issue advocate} - engages policy to promote a particular decision; and \emph{honest broker of policy alternatives} - presents all the relevant alternatives to policy derived by synthesising scientific knowledge. \textcite{RapleyD2014} add to this list \emph{science communicator}, who engage society in the conversation. Acknowledging the existential threat posed by the climate and nature crisis, \textcite{GregoryBW2024} propose the \emph{honest advocate} (advocates for a particular policy outcome whilst keep to strict criteria of honesty and transparency).  Pielke's roles are derived from the literature on Science and Technology Studies (\cite{Pielke2007}, p8). However, within Policy Studies, other roles are envisaged, particularly the \emph{policy entrepreneur} (advocates for particular proposals using a range of strategies) (\cite{Kingdon1993,Cairney2018}) and \emph{problem broker} (frames and advocates for a particular policy problem) (\cite{Knaggard2015}). Whilst these latter roles are often discussed uncritically, sometimes even [praised] for their ability to `get policy over the line', they lack legitimacy, accountability and transparency (\cite{vonMalmborg2024strategies}) and are thus [anathemic] to scientific [practice]. Thus, it may be surmised that the ability of scientists to influence policy is somewhat [hamstrung] by the constraints of [acceptable] scientific roles, constraints that do not apply to other other roles being played at the interface. [Crouzat et al. 2018 reference in \cite{BalvaneraJNOBCDGGKKMPSSW2020}) ][co producing solutions by building bridges between a range of knowledges \cite{NorstromEtAl2020} in \cite{BalvaneraJNOBCDGGKKMPSSW2020}, \cite{MatukBSAHT2020}]
credibility balanced with usefulness \cite{WesselinkH2020}
constraint of credibility does not apply to other advocacy roles that aim to influence policy makers (\cite{Kingdon1993,Knaggard2015,Cairney2018,vonMalmborg2024strategies})

\cite{SteelLLS2004,SinghTKMMC2014} - 5 roles: reporting, interpreting, integrating, taking a position, decision making

Levien 1979 identified 3 roles for scientists - clear description including uncertainties, options, contributing to problem solving (get citiation from \cite{SteelLLS2004})

\cite{ColognaKMBMO2024} scientists' advocacy for greater action may not affect credibility but advocating for a specific policy may

\cite{ColognaKMBMO2024} - important for scientists to demonstrate competence, benevolence, integrity and openness

\cite{Horton2022} - classic example of Pure Science approach at the policy interface - ``the scientists made no political recommendations, as they were there simply to present the science'' - very little, possible nothing, came of it.

\cite{FuntowiczR1993,Jasanoff2003} - in our era of \emph{post-normal science} scientists should form \emph{extended peer communities} with other affected citizens to consider impacts of their science and of policy interventions (also \cite{KalafatisL2019})

\subsection{role tensions}
For some time been recognised that a tension exists between the values and rigour espoused by scholars and the moral and political framework into which they submit their knowledge (\cite{Nau2009}, quoting \cite[p263]{Bull1972} ))
\cite{ColognaKMBMO2024} - may be nuance in advocacy``Trust in scientists not affected by their respectful advocacy for greater climate action but their credibility may be affected by advocating for a specific policy''
\cite{DablanderSCSBGGBAH2024} - ``research suggests that loss of credibility due to advocacy depends on the advocated policy''
Some have taken to the media, they feel so strongly, e.g. ``scientists misuse their authority [and undermine the credibility of climate science] if they publicise their preferred policy options'' \cite{Edwards2013}
\cite{Gerber2023} - ``contributing to policy does not have the same prestige on a tenure application as publishing high-profile research papers''

\cite{MacKillopCDD2023} - tensions in knowledge brokerage organisations: ``objectivity versus finding common ground, making recommendations, influencing and steering''

\cite{WesselinkH2020} - contrast between the sacred objectivity versus proface co-production of solutions - balancing credibility and usefulness
\cite{GregoryBW2024} - ``environmental scientists and key scientific roles in society could be best described as a Science Arbiter or Honest Broker''
\cite{GregoryBW2024} - ``a small but growing number of high-profile academics also act vocally as Issue Advocates on both climate and nature''
\cite{GregoryBW2024} - honest advocate has potential to have policy influence also potential risk to scientific credibility
\cite{GregoryBW2024} - ``the risk to scientific credibility might be equally high if scientists failed to engage actively in advocacy too, especially when they judge threats to be extreme''

\cite{JagannathanEtAl2023} - there is disagreement with ``Scientists are apolitical actors in the SPI''

\cite{Makin2024} - different languages used by climate scientists and economists, even most basic terms like risk and tolerance of uncertainty

\cite{MacKillopCDD2023} - in KBOs ``asked to play a political role by doing what they referred to as `policy-based evidence' rather than evidence-informed policymaking''

\cite{vonMalmborg2024strategies} - questions the role of PEs and how well they align to democrat norms and principles: legitimacy - input, throughput and output legitimacy; accountability; transparency and publicity; openness and equality; impartiality and fairness; justice - procedural and distributive; suggesting they are ``illiberal and antidemocratic actors using democratic institutions and functions to reach their Ultimate Goal''

Perceptions of scientists e.g. \cite{McNiePS2017} consider several science values as ``narrow'' and ``constrained''

\cite{Buntgen2024} - Argues that scientists should not be activists because they should not have prior interest in the outcome of their studies

Personal accounts from science advisers (\cite{Stirling2010,Hicks2024}) articulate  tensions between the desire of policymakers for certainty and consensus, and the disputed and uncertain nature of scientifc knowledge. Such pluralities of perspective may be difficult to reconcile in policy settings that demand communications in a condensed form. This is not simply frustrating, scientists and science itself can be reputationally damaged when nuance is insufficiently communicated (\cite{Stirling2010,OjanenBKP2021}). 

\section{Influences on policy}\label{sec:litinfluence}

The literature on influence related to the \SPI{} fall largely into two disciplines. The first, from [policy studies] concerns the behaviours of individuals, groups and processes in policymaking, deriving a range of theories about how these factors play out. \textcite{KernR2018} perform an excellent analysis of how the main 5 theories in this literature apply to sustainability transitions. The second literature, from [behaviour science] concerns the influences on, and responses of, individuals and is largely focused on the behaviour of individuals and society. \textcite{Darnton2008} provides a detailed resource that brings together a multitude of these models (alongside theories of change). The former literature largely focuses on the strategic behaviours of those wishing to influence policy, whereas the latter largely focuses on what influences people in society, which is of value to designing policy. There is a disconnection between these two bodies of work, with, as yet, little reference to behavioural models in policy studies theory. However, there is a little recognition that behaviour change is as pertinent to the \SPI{} as it is to society at large (\cite{CairneyW2017}) and so this section draws out pertinent findings in both these literatures to the engagement of scientists with \CAN-related policy.

Without reference to literature, many attempts to influence others suppose that they are deficient in the relevant information. The so-called \glsxtrlong{idm} (\IDM) \emph{Information Deficit Model} has unknown origins (\cite{Nerlich2017}) and may simply be an intuitive response: ``if they knew what I know, they'd behave differently''. However, a number of related models have been developed based on ideas of information deficit (\cite{Darnton2008}). The \IDM{} prompts a strategy of communicating more information. This has been more formalised regarding \CAN{} issues as the Gateway Belief Model, through which \textcite{vanderLindenLFM2015} and \textcite{vanderLinden2021} posit that communicating scientific consensus on climate change will alter attitudes to the issue. Whilst the \IDM{} has largely been shown to have only short-term relevance (\cite[p24-5]{BA2024trust}), the intuition that more information is what is needed to create change no doubt continues to motivate knowledge sharing strategies.

Moving beyond models of information deficit, behavioural science and environmental psychology propose a wide range of models to describe what motivates and constrains people's behaviours (\cite{Darnton2008}). Recent effort have created compilations of behaviour change models, with a particular aim to support the social transitions required to address \CAN{} issues. These includes the \glsxtrlong{ism} (\ISM) (\cite{DarntonH2013}, based on \cite{SouthertonME2011}), the Theoretical Domains Framework (\cite{AtkinsFIOPIFDCGLM2017}), and the model of \textcite{HamptonW2023} which brings together individual, social, physical and political sources of influence. 

\paragraph{Bounded rationality}

\section{Strategic actions for engaging with policy}

Knowing one's role and what influences policy 

The policy studies literature provides theories about actions that improve outcomes of engagement at the \SPI{} (e.g. \cite{RykielEtAl2002,McNie2007,Gluckman2014,BlessenohlS2022}), although this is not widely used in research into climate justice policy (\cite{CairneyTS2023}). Empirical evidence about actions is harder to come by. \textcite{OliverHBGC2022} review the empirical evidence of how research impacts policy, but find it lacks rigour. Combining the policy studies and empirical literatures, along with `how to' advice, \textcite{OliverC2019} synthesised  8 tips for influencing policy. I have used the broad outline of this latter work to structure this section, somewhat simplifying each tip to reduce the overlaps and, where possible, instead of theoretical literature, I have drawn on empirical evidence to illustrate each tip.

\subsection{Do high quality research}

\cite{OjanenBKP2021} describe tensions related to creating rigorous, policy-relevant research such as dynamic policy contexts, disagreement of research outputs with official government data, and the dominance of influential policymakers over political priorities
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} strategies to create relevant research included collaboration with relevant policy actors
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} having rigorous and transparent research supported scientists in cases when the research outputs were contested by policymakers
\cite{IbarraJOBCIMRS2022} scientists in this study considered the idea of usable knowledge too simplistic 
\cite{IbarraJOBCIMRS2022} requirements for science to be useful and excellent ``do not necessarily lead to the desired policy relevance''
\cite{DanfordDR2009} this becomes more difficult with pressure to commercialise research
\cite{RoseBOP2018} Lawton Review's success partly due to good rigorous science


 timely, policy relevant, and easy to understand, but not at the expense of accuracy ... systematic reviews/evidence synthesis ... communicate scientific uncertainty and the strengths and weaknesses of a piece of research
\paragraph{relevance}
\cite{Gerber2023} - ``compelling scientific results with an agency decision-maker who looked at me and said,You're answering a question I'm not asking you''
\cite{GluckmanBK2021} - consider the demand (policy) side and policy dynamics of the issue [Bisbal2024 cites McNie2007 for this]

\cite{LubchencoR2020} - increase in recent years in use-inspired science
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} - suggest that forest researchers: ensuring policy-relevance
\paragraph{evidence quality}
\cite{CairneyO2020} - a ``safe solution''
\cite{IbarraJOBCIMRS2022} - excellence, relevance, credibility, legitimacy are necessary but not suffiient precursers for taking a seat at the table in climate governance
\paragraph{policy area}
\cite{SaxonbergSL2023} - some policy areas are more ideologically charged than others - [CAN is likely to be highly charged] affecting experience and outcomes 
\cite{WesselinkH2020} - framing of the policy problem (defines the need for science)
\cite{WesselinkH2020} - BO's success depends on: culture of the policy domain
\cite{WesselinkH2020} - BO's success depends on: characteristics of the policy problem itself
\cite{MoallemiZHSMZHKHMGLB2023} - opportunities include: Create trusted knowledge from multiple sources

\subsubsection{make your research relevant and readable}
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} requests for scientists to and/or refusal of scientists to censor the content of communications
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} some scientists refrained from presenting on certain issues, such as social justice, perceiving that this was unpalatable to some more powerful policymakers
\cite{IbarraJOBCIMRS2022} scientists found it difficult to communicate uncertatinty in policy advice
\cite{RoseBOP2018} Lawton Review's success partly due to clear accessible language and politically salient frames
\cite{Obermeister2022} finds how science advisers become ``bilingual''

engage in more effective dissemination ... make data public ... provide clear summaries and syntheses of problems and solutions ... Use a range of outputs (social media, blogs, policy briefs), to make sure that policy actors can contact you with follow up questions ...write for generalist, but not ignorant readers ... use established storytelling techniques
\paragraph{credibility}
\cite{GluckmanBK2021} - identify constraints on scientific claims - inferential gap between knowledge and conclusions
\cite{GluckmanBK2021} - assess the evidence base (quantity and quality of available evidence)
\cite{GluckmanBK2021} - evaluate the level of `consensus'
\cite{ElsensohnACDGGKPRS2019} - ``provide clear and accurate information''
\paragraph{communication}
\cite{LubchencoR2020} - science communication via social media 
\cite{vonMalmborg2024strategies} - PEs do: ``Attention and support seeking strategies - Problem framing; idea generation. Strategic dissemination of information. Lead by example; use demonstration projects. Rhetorical persuasion; media attention. Exploitation of focusing event(s)''
\cite{ThompsonD2024} - multiple engagement methods (webinar, workshop), concise briefs, clear recommendations for policy
\paragraph{openness}
\cite{ElsensohnACDGGKPRS2019} - science advocates should remain issue-focussed, provide clear and accurate information, be honest about uncertainty, be aware of own and audiences values, expertise, biases and needs, and be aware of role of language
\cite{GluckmanBK2021} - communicate the uncertainties, caveats and reliability of evidence

\cite{SimmsA2020,Carton2021,Bendell2024} - some scientists calling for a more frank, uncensored ``framing'' of climate science because ``collectively and individually, we have serially underplayed the implications of our research findings in communicating them to policymakers, the wider public and sometimes ourselves'' (\cite{CalverleyA2022})

\cite{ReadO2017} - ``Scientists are typically concerned above all to avoid false positives, orfalse alarms'' which may explain why many scientists are relatively cautious in their claims and public pronouncements
\cite{GregoryBW2024} - note concern of some scientists (Pearson) about ``crying wolf''
\cite{PoeS2023} - Science culture of risk is very averse to false positives unlike insurance or defence who are very averse to false negatives


\subsubsection{understand policy processes}
scientists can lack confidence to engage \cite{KEU2021perceptions,ElsensohnACDGGKPRS2019}
\cite{Obermeister2022} with experience science advisers learn the nonlinearities of the policy process and to work with it

 get to know how policy works, and in particular to accept that the normative technocratic ideal of `evidence-based' policymaking does not reflect the political nature of decision-making ... science [may] hold a privileged position in policy ... research is unlikely to translate directly into an off-the-shelf ready-to-wear policy proposal ... learn the basics ... learn to recognise broader policymaking dynamics, paying particular attention to changing policy priorities ... what, when, where and who to influence 
 \paragraph{skills and knowledge}
\cite{BednarekSHG2015,Mintrom2019} - a range of skills that are needed to be effective at the interface
\cite{Braun2009} - study on specific engagement found that knowledge and information build powerful individuals and networks
\cite{GogginEtAl2015} - attribute of successful practitioners included Expert/ rigorous/ respected scientist/ technical skills/ publishes in scientific literature
\cite{MoallemiZHSMZHKHMGLB2023} - opportunities include: Empower learning and collaboration

\cite{MoallemiZHSMZHKHMGLB2023} - opportunities include: Account for politics and inclusive governance
\cite{SaxonbergSL2023} - political context affects experiences and outcomes
\cite{StrassheimK2014} - ``evidence is neglected and distorted because it conflicts with political values and ideologies (normative selectivity) or it is ignored and misinterpreted as a result of limited politico-administrative perception (cognitive selectivity)''
\cite{WesselinkH2020} - BO's success depends on: (inter)national political culture 

\subsubsection{be accessible to policymakers: engage routinely, flexible, and humbly}
`build trust' and `develop good relationships' ... maintaining long-term relationships takes effort, time and commitment ... may require a commitment to remaining non-partisan ... respectful, helpful, and humble demeanour ... their own language, practices and values 

\subsubsection{decide if you want to be an issue advocate or honest broker}
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} describe  misunderstanding by policymakers of the role and capability of science in the policy arena, such as by requesting policy advice that scientists did not feel it appropriate to give

consider how to draw the line between providing information or recommendations ... simply disseminate their research honestly, clearly, and in a timely fashion, acting as an `honest broker' of the evidence base [or] recommend specific policy options or describe the implications for policy based on their research ... boundary between these two options is very difficult to negotiate or identify in practice
\cite{Horton2022} - report on the presentation of climate science to parliament ``the scientists made no political recommendations, as they were there simply to present the science''


\subsubsection{build relationships (and ground rules) with policymakers}
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} scientists found haveing strong relationships with policymakers [immunised] them from contestation of their research, even when that research was critical of government policies
\cite{SaxonbergSL2023} establishing personal contacts with key players and being collaborative led to more influence

could give researchers better access to opportunities to shape policy agendas ... develop shared interpretations of the policy problem ... Co-designing, or otherwise doing research-for-policy together is widely held to be morally, ethically, and practically one of the best ways to achieve the elusive goal of getting evidence into policy
\paragraph{networks and relationships}

\cite{OjanenBKP2021} - suggest that forest researchers: building good relationships with policymakers was essential for policy relevance but also impacted ability to openly discuss critical research
\cite{SaxonbergSL2023} - establishing personal contacts with key players and being collaborative leads to more influence
\cite{ThompsonD2024} - networks, build relationships
\subsubsection{be `entrepreneurial' or find someone who is}
daring, persuasive scientist, comfortable in policy environments and always available when needed ... mentors to build networks, or through `cold calling' ... Some ideas and values need to be fought for if they are to achieve dominance ... multiple strategies may be required ... also be pragmatic, by identifying real, tangible impacts and delivering them

\subsubsection{reflect continuously: should you engage, do you want to, and is it working?}
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} found some scientists' involvement in \SPI{} was contested due to their nationality being different from the policy setting, others found that a ``foreigner'' status enabled them to detach from the political context 
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} scientists in interviews were often self-reflective and self-critical when considering their difficulties with creating useful knowledge for policymaking, as well as tensions around communicating politically-[uncomfortable] findings and demonstrating impact
\cite{Obermeister2022} science advisers learn to recognise the limits to their agency

good fit ... if they `want to be in real world', `enjoy finding solutions to complex problems' ... or are driven `by a passion greater than simply adding another item to your CV'
\paragraph{self-reflection}
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} - suggest that forest researchers: self-reflection, humbleness
\paragraph{values}
\cite{GeuijenMCRv2017} - suggest a means to hold different perspectives on public value

\cite{VoisardW2023} - practical climate ethics, how to decide on way forward
\cite{PascualEtAl2018} - need to recognise different worldviews and values
\cite{RogeljLPLWXXXX} - suggest using principles
\paragraph{effort}
\cite{BednarekSHG2015} - ``efforts required in the enterprise of connecting science and policy can often exceed the skill sets or time constraints of individual scientists
\paragraph{beliefs}
\cite{CairneyW2017} - ``ideas or beliefs that dominate the ways in which [policymakers] think about problems and solutions''
\cite{BalvaneraJNOBCDGGKKMPSSW2020} - highlight that scientists' belief in the superiority of scientific knowledge causes a departure from recognised roles for scientists
\cite{BerkebileWeinbergGDVV2024} - belief in climate change and support for climate policy is related to political ideology

\subsection{other influences}
these are good recommendations, probably necessary, but not sufficient for gaining influence


The relative influence of these strategic activities are moderated by other factors such as:
events that open windows of opportunity \cite{RoseBOP2018}
political context and policy area \cite{IbarraJOBCIMRS2022,SaxonbergSL2023,VelanderD2024}
institutional setting \cite{WeyrauchES2016,OjanenBKP2021,SaxonbergSL2023}
power \cite{MacKillopCDD2023}

These have been exp 

** impact
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} competition between different levels and areas of governance to demonstrate impact hindered coordination and collaboration, although ``cumulative efforts by a diversity of actors as well as an element of luck'' were seen as pivotal to research impact
\cite{IbarraJOBCIMRS2022} publishing in highly ranked journals and have a relevant presence in local media were not enough to be influential in climate policy

** power
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} many of the tensions described speak to power imbalances within the \SPI{} as well as beyond it, including colonial legacies
\cite{IbarraJOBCIMRS2022} politics plays a role in influence of scientific advice
\cite{MacKillopCDD2023} - power plays role in the creation of KBOs
\paragraph{power}
\cite{StrassheimK2014} tensions due to selectivity and power - ``intensive and complex struggle for political and epistemic authority on both sides; science as well as policy''

\paragraph{funding}
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} - forest researchers tensions and frustration include: impact on research of funding and funders
\paragraph{emotions}
\cite{RandallH2019} - climate scientists ``face the disturbing reality of climate change on a regular basis'' may experience strong emotions as a consequence of their own scientific understanding and ``confusion'' about the responses they experience when sharing their knowledge

\cite{Carrington2024} - guardian article about scientists' despair
\cite{Makin2024} - Emotion plays a role in shaping how a concept is represented

\section{Measuring impact}
Ultimately, scientists and policymakers want to know how to close the gap between knowledge and policy goals. A recent review of activities to promote research-policy engagement found an array of practices, and an increase in their prevalence, but little evaluation of their efficacy (\cite{OliverHBGC2022}). The authors found that the aims of these activities were poorly defined with little reference to existing knowledge about engagement practices.  
\cite{BednarekSHG2015} - measuring impact is difficult in any complex setting
REF probably the most well know structured approach to measuring policy impact of research.
\cite{KEU2021impact} - for REF 2021 policy impact is a combination of ``reach'' and ``significance'' via direct and indirect contact with policymakers, admits that this is difficult to evidence
\cite{BoswellS2017} - REF assumes linear model (and can adversely affect strategies such as building collaborations)
\cite{Cairney2018} - REF builds on the linear model
\cite{CairneyO2020} - ``more challenging issues ... arise when we consider what it would take to secure real, long term policy impact with evidence''
\cite{JagannathanEtAl2023} - defining and evaluating success in creating actionable knowledge remains an area of active research

When trying to describe the gap between science and policy it is valuable to be able to articulate what close that gap would look like\unsure{what do writings about the science policy gap want to see improved?}
In the arena of CAN policy, the clearest measure would be if policy ambition met with physical modelling of the need to close the gap between budget and emissions. Other measures would be to reach zero habitat loss? 

\cite{BednarekSHG2015} - section 4.4 Measuring impact is difficult in any complex setting 
\cite{JagannathanEtAl2023} - section 4.1.1 identify that ``How do we define and evaluate success in producing actionable knowledge?'' needs deeper research as the definition and methodologies are very context-dependant
\cite{KEU2021impact} - its difficult to define impact, for REF 2021 it comes down to reach and significance

\section{Empirical studies}
For scientists who ``want to be more than chroniclers of a preventable tragedy'' (\cite{WyattGT2024}), what is the experience of engaging with \CAN-related policy one option is to engage 
Evidence is emerging that this lack of action is emotionally damaging for \CAN{} scientists (\cite{Carrington2024}) and

\section{scientists own words}
\cite{Hicks2024} - scientists feel about having to advise when they know that the nuances and uncertainties of their work are not going to be appreciated.
\cite{Gluckman2014} - reflections after years in advice and as knowledge broker
\cite{WyattGT2024} - more scientists as activists
\cite{ThompsonD2024} - Christina Demski as science adviser

\section{Justification for this work}
Work on how scientists can engage with policy has often been rather normative, describing the needs of policymakers and how scientists must align to these with little accounting for the context in which the scientist finds themself (e.g. \cite{McNie2007,GeddesDP2018,BlessenohlS2022,Bisbal2024}). 

\cite{CairneyO2020} - ``reject the idea that political scientists can draw on generally applicable `how to' advice''
\cite{CairneyO2020} - scholars face major dilemmas when engaging with policy
\cite{CairneyTS2023} - find that in the climate justice literature there is little use of policy theory to seek practical lessons such as how to advocate for policy change  - `` theory-informed studies do not solve the problems raised by climate justice scholars, they provide the concepts or language to help identify patterns and mechanics of policy change'' [so whilst not using theory - are they applying it in practice?]
\cite{JagannathanEtAl2023} - boundary spanning ``roles and their associated practices, expectations, institutional supports, and capacities vary greatly ... empirical analyses of such boundary functions are far and few ... also limited examination of the risks they may face while engaging in such a crucial role''

\cite{KennyRHTB2017} - ``examined only the parliamentary demand-side of the research-to-use ecosystem. Equally important are the supply-side researchers and the many intermediaries who translate research for parliamentary use''

\cite{EdlerKB2022} - moving the focus from the activities of scientists and the incentive structure in scientific organisations to the policy user side.

There is a sense from the literature of a tension between scholars of science and scholars of policy as to where the greater portion of [blame] for this gap falls (for instance [science papers] compared to studies quoted in 

Whilst providing some essential insights into the state of understanding about what works at the science-policy interface, articles such as \textcite{OliverHBGC2022} and \textcite{Oliver202X} indicating that ``much of the evidence-policy `gap' can be attributed to problems within academia''


There is a great deal more work prescribing the ideal roles and behaviours of scientists engaging with policy than there is of their experiences of doing so. Like the issues underlying the CAN crises themselves, it is not enough to simply provide instructions. First we need to understand experiences and the influences over behaviours. This study aims to initiate this first step...


\section{text dump}

\cite{JagannathanEtAl2023} - ``Among these numerous frameworks, science-policy interface (SPI) (van Ravenswaay et al., 1983) is one of the earliest and most popular, that describes the exchange between science and decision-making''
place that knowledge exchange between science and policy occurs

models of science-policy relations - the standard model of evidence influencing policy and work that challenges this\\
examples of science-policy interfaces in climate policy, e.g. institutions, projects

\subsubsection{rational model}
\cite{BoswellS2017} - linear model ``widely debunked'', presents 4 models of research-policy relations
\cite{BednarekSHG2015} - ``complicated and erratic flow of information''
\cite{McNie2007} - nice review of work talking about the linear model section 2.2.1. Policy
\cite{HaynesDCRHGS2011} - ``Linear, rational depictions of the 'the policy cycle' are increasingly viewed as idealised normative models that poorly describe a far messier social process (Greenhalgh, 2006, Hanney et al., 2003, Lewis, 2006).''
\textcite{BoswellS2017} states that this linear  interface is ``widely debunked''. They instead offer 3 alternative models by which policy and science interact (or fail to interact) in non-linear directions. If the nature of the interface between science and policy does not meet expectations 
\cite{Cairney2018} - ``rational policymaking during a policy cycle'' - ``the biggest work of fiction in policy studies'
\cite{StrassheimK2014} - argues that the other side of evidence-based policy may be policy-based evidence ``evidence-based policy immunising itself against criticism and thus turning into policy-based evidence''
\cite{Obermeister2020} - describes how the \SPI{} is constantly evolving as the values, demands and understanding of science, policy and society continually developing

\subsubsection{CAN issues}
\cite{IPBES2022} - Nature is deteriorating and this is happening more rapidly
\cite{IIPCC2022} - ``rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all''
\cite{TschakertEAKO2019} - so many intangible climate-related harms
\cite{McKayEtAl2022} - prospect for even a slight increase in global temperature has ``serious implications for humanity''  - urgent action needed  
\cite{WEF2024} - WEF Global Risks Report finds climate and nature risks increasing in severity to making up half of the top 10 impacts over the coming decade. 
\cite{LaybournTS2023} - transformation of societies is necessary to meet climate goals
\cite{Killick2023} -  politicians have changed their perspectives a great deal, but environment is still ``tacked onto how they always thought about the economy'' this may not be so for future generations of politicians
\cite{Carrington2024} - lead authors and review editors on IPCC reports are largely pessimistic about the future

\cite{WesselinkH2020} - with a low certainty of knowledge and poor agreement on goals, environmental crises are ``unstructured problems'' - they are characterised as agenda-changing politics, crisis management; deliberation and learning in emergent network(s) (akin to \cite{RittelW1973} wicked problems). The failure to solve them is due to not recognising this nature.
\cite[p739]{FuntowiczR1993} - post-normal science - ``remedy the pathologies of the global industrial system of which it forms the basis''

\subsubsection{boundary organisations}
research centres (e.g. Tyndall Centre, Hadley Centre (\cite{WesselinkH2020}) 
worldwide to focus on convening knowledge and designing policy in response to specific issues
\cite{MacKillopCDD2023} - knowledge-brokerage organisations
\cite{OlejniczakBDP2019} - policy labs
\cite{VelanderD2024} - UN convention SPI

\subsubsection{other epistemologies}
\cite{PascualEtAl2018} - means to bridge different worldviews and values
Policymakers and scientists have different worldviews. What constitutes evidence to a policymaker can be varied from rigorously-derived evidence to individual stories (\cite{PiddingtonMD2024}).
\cite{MatukBSAHT2020} - including diverse knowledges, worldviews and values in process at IPBES
\cite{IbarraJOBCIMRS2022} - science knowledge is not neutral, tends to be situated, Western and decisions need to embrace other knowledges, especially country's civic epistemology

\subsubsection{imperative to engage}


\cite{CairneyTS2023} find that researchers in climate change, policy, justice and equity seek (a) transformation of systems of governance (b) mainstreaming of justice / policy integration (c) organise to overcome neoliberalism (d) design effective policy tools

\cite{KennyRHTB2017} - In a 2017 study interviewing MPs and staff in UK parliament `` academic research is not cutting through; for example, the voluntary sector outperforms the higher education sector in terms of written and oral evidence submissions to committees in Parliament.''
\cite{KEU2021perceptions} - A study at the same time (2017) found majority of academics had low confidence about engaging with parliament
\cite{KarlssonG2020} - characterise the gap as consequence of both science delay and policy delay



\subsubsection{other stuff}
strategies\footnote{Throughout this study I use the term ``strategy'' to identify strategic behaviours and actions, those that are consciously taken to achieve an aim. Whilst, strictly, these are tactics, this term is consistent with descriptions of  I refer to strategies to align but the term  e.g. \cite{WeimerV2015}}

\cite{LubchencoR2020} - in 1998 Lubchenco called for greater effort by scientists to make science accessible, understandable, relevant and credible - whilst much has been achieved in 2 decades, still barriers, largely due to the nature of the institutions of science
\cite{Gerber2023} - scientists should answer the questions posed by policy but what if policy is not asking the right questions? e.g. Emphasis of policy on NET ValiverronenS2021, CalverleyA2022, Carton2021, CartonHML2023 rather than behaviour and society
\cite{Bisbal2024} - expresses the frustration of the policymaker unable to gain the knowledge they require and suggests actions that scientists can take 


the issues of credibility, objectivity, etc. To an extent disadvantage scientists. Voluntary sector outperforms high education KennyRHTB2017. CernaTHTTS2020 said that ``Greta Thunberg has been more successful in communicating the globally agreed scientific facts concerning climate change that the thousands of scientists actively involved in the International Panel on Climate Change'' yet Greta was not bound by the restrictions of scientific practice. Yet, policymakers are also influenced by actors playing issue and policy and advocacy roles that may have much less legitimacy, accountability and transparency (\cite{Kingdon1993,Knaggard2015,Cairney2018,vonMalmborg2024strategies}) , potentially putting scientists at an influential disadvantage. Voluntary sector outperforms higher education KennyRHTB2017. studies looking mainly at the experience of the demand-side / policy

Of course, the policy maker plays their role be selecting the knowledge to be used. W  Decisions makers can choose to ignore evidence (e.g. \cite{TennoyHLN2016}), rarely needing to justify what they include and what they leave out\footnote{not the case with EU Climate Change Advisory Board \cite{WardmanE2023}}.


Also, less well documented\unsure{is it?} are the power influences at play, that policy, even policy based on scientific understanding, such as the nature of climate change, is [pertinent to] other factors such as commercial interests, concerns about social acceptance of transition [activities] [etc]. [supranational nature of climate governance, colonialism and imperialism in geopolitics, power relations in national governance and decision-making, lobbying by vested interests, dominance of economics and financial interests in governance, etc.]

scientists instead turn to activism \cite{Pivovarchuk2024,GregoryBW2024}

\subsection{A wicked problem}
Wicked problems \cite{RittelW1973}
\cite{WesselinkH2020} - unstructured problem - low certainty of knowledge (social science) low agreement on goals

, particularly given the `wicked' nature of the issues and their possible solutions (\cite{Cairney2016}, p94). 

[Thus, to date, whilst UK can demonstrate some strong statitics c.f. other countries in terms of decarbonisation of electricity grid [refs], these transitions have been largely down to technological changes and have required little individual or societal change. Further decarbonisation of UK economy will mostly now require changes that affect individuals and their mobility, homes, and leisure habits.]

\subsection{Two cultures}
These messier interactions result, at least in part, from the contrasting ``cultures'' of science and policy \cite{Obermeister2022}. Whereas as science values objectivity most highly, policy values decisiveness\unsure{policy - decisiveness?}. Where science sets a very high bar for what is considered ``evidence'', ``Policy is founded on a plurality of knowledge''\unsure{check quotes} (\cite{GluckmanBK2021}, e.g. \cite{PiddingtonMD2024}). Science (particularly the environmental sciences) prefers to only infer the most likely scenarios, policy (founded on economic projections) is comfortable considering worst-cases ([PoeS2023, Pearson reference in GregoryBW2024: crying wolf, ReadO2017]). There are linguistic differences between the two cultures whereby the same word (such as ``uncertainty'', ``risk''  and ``error'') have different meanings (\cite{SomervilleH2011,Makin2024}[De Meyer,]). Scientists can even be reluctant to make confident statements about what they know, preferring instead to talk about what they don't know (\cite{MountfordD2023}). These different cultures serve the purposes of pure science and policymaking well, but create barriers to effective conveyance of knowledge into policy and decision-making.


\subsection{science policy contexts}

understood now that context of policymaking is relevant \cite{CairneyW2017} and models of these contexts have been devised \cite{WeyrauchES2016}

The science related to CAN policy is extremely varied. Policy can require knowledge about the measurement, mitigation of and adaptation to the changes that humans are causing to climate and nature. Relevant science includes the methods for measurement and ongoing monitoring of the natural world and human infrastructure, technologies for ghg emissions reduction and drawdown, technologies to reduce impacts from climate destabilisation and nature depletion, and behavioural and social science to transform individual and societal activities to reduce ghg emissions and adapt to a changing environment. technology, physical, social science

\subsection{Scientists' experiences of policy}\label{sec:experiences}
\emph{review of literature describing the experience of scientists - I believe my study is one of very few looking at science-policy specifically from the scientists' perspective}
\cite{OjanenBKP2021} deep investigation of experiences of forest researchers  - include more detail from this
