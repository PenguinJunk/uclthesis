\section{Foundation}\label{sec:metmotivation}

This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the influences on scientists who engage at the \CAN{} \SPI. It took as a foundation the normative-prescriptive Policy Studies advice for scientists and complemented this with a descriptive-analytic study of the real-world experiences of scientists. 
Guided by a phenomological theory of enquiry (\cite{CreswellP2017}), this was a qualitative investigation using semi-structured interviews to collect data for description and analysis. 
By using behavioural insights, the study sought to uncover a range of influences on scientists. %, beyond the lack of information about how to engage that is suggested in the advice literature. % experience and the practices they use to adapt to, mitigate, or to capitalise on, these influences. 
%This study focuses on the UK \SPI{} defined by \CAN{} science and policy. %, conceptualising \CAN{} science as a \PNS{} and therefore a domain in which science is one of many knowledges to be used in policymaking. 
There were three methodological phases: identification and invitation of potential participants (Section~\ref{sec:metidentify}), interviewing of participants (Section~\ref{sec:metinterview}), and transcript labelling and analysis (Section~\ref{sec:metlabelling}).
 %A short quantitative analysis was also undertaken (Section~\ref{sec:metquant}).


%I identify myself as a broad-[spectrum] scientist, having studied environmental sciences, focussing on monitoring the land- and sea-scape using remote sensing. I have spent more than 2 decades focussed on developing algorithms for processing aerial imagery. Much of that time, I worked with neural network algorithms, including introducing deep learning to an arms length government organisation, whilst all the time maintaining a passion for, and occasional activism about, the natural world. The present study emerged out of the mismatch I directly perceived between scientific understanding, both regarding the natural world and technological issues (particularly regarding so-called ``artificial intelligence''), and public decision making.

%\section{Definitions}\label{sec:metdefinitions}


%What I mean by policymaker - from \cite{Obermeister2020} - ``By `policymakers' I broadly mean (influential) actors within government departments, the legislative branch (e.g. Parliament), and/or organisations with statutory powers (e.g. non-departmental public bodies), who are chiefly concerned with policy formulation and evaluation as opposed to enforcement.''

\section{Identifying potential participants}\label{sec:metidentify}
This study focused on \CAN{} science-policy within the UK. To locate the UK \SPI, and thus identify scientists who have engaged at the UK \SPI, this study delineated UK public policy as the process of creating laws, regulations, guidance, and commitments that pertain UK government decision-making. Consequently, UK \CAN-related policymaking and policymakers were considered to be situated in local, devolved, national and supra-national governments, UK parliament and in government bodies with remits for advising on, and/or executing, \CAN{} government policy.

Scientists were identified as individuals with a research background in \CAN-related science (e.g. from the disciplines of Ecology, Earth science, Environmental Psychology). Potential participants in this study were identified using several sources. Firstly, case studies and blog posts on the \REF{} and \UKRI{} websites were used to identify \CAN{} science research that was labelled as having impact on public policy. This included searching the \href{https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact}{REF Impact database}\footnote{Unfortunately, at the time the \UKRI{} \href{https://gtr.gtr.ukri.org/}{Gateway to Research database} was not functioning}. Other potential participants were elicited from participants at the end of the earlier interviews.

Potential participants were invited by individual email to take part in a 1-hour online interview related to ``research into the experience of scientists involved in climate and nature-related policy''. Willing participants were asked to complete an ethics consent form and were able to book themselves a suitable time for the interview.

\section{Interviews}\label{sec:metinterview}

The interviews were structured around a series of prompts designed to build a picture of scientists' experiences of engaging with policy. The aim was to create a relaxed setting in which participants were comfortable sharing their experiences, with an emphasis on learning about these experiences in the participants' own words. Therefore, the interview questions were phrased and ordered to flow as naturally as possible from participants' previous answers, leaving out questions if these were naturally answered in response to a previous question. Table~\ref{tab:metinterview} gives prompts and example questions, although in the interviews these were often much less formal (e.g. of the form ``\textit{you mentioned X, please could you tell me more about it?}'').

     & ``\textit{is there anything else you'd like to tell me about?}'' \\[2ex] \hline

The interviews took place over Microsoft Teams and were video recorded and automatically transcribed. Each transcription was then refined by the researcher by watching the video and correcting and annotating the transcription. Transcripts were broken down into statements, usually whole or part sentences, or occasionally groups of sentences, each conveying singular point relevant to experiences of scientists. These statements were stored as \CSV{} files with one statement per line. This file format permitted multiple labels to be applied to each statement.

\section{Transcript labelling}\label{sec:metlabelling}

The transcript \CSV s were combined into a single \CSV{} file and loaded into Microsoft Excel with columns assigned to each factor in the analysis framework. The \ISM{} (Figure~\ref{fig:ism}) was chosen as the analysis framework because this consolidates research into the many influences on behaviour (\cite{DarntonH2013}, see also \cite{MinamitaniDOI2024} for an example application). Because the \ISM{} was designed for individuals in society, rather than for professionals in policy settings, it was complemented with insights from the behavioural framework of \textcite{HamptonW2023}, which includes political influences. The framework of \textcite{BuseMW2012} (and its expansion, \cite{HaynesDCRHGS2011}) was also referenced in the analysis. This is not based on behavioural understandings but did help to identify core components of policy settings.

Labels describing the broad nature of the relevant factor(s) (``indicator labels'') were entered against each statement. Several iterations were performed which involved both subdividing and grouping indicator labels for each factor. The final result of this labelling was that each statement had an indicator label in one or more of the \ISM{} factors. For example, the statement \tquote{In some ways that was quite shocking}{p04}{62} had the indicator label ``surprise'' in the \ismie{} factor. Statements were also given labels to describe the nature of the knowledge exchange (if any), and whether the statement was about a success, a frustration and/or a strategic practice being described or suggested by the participant.
