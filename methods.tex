Participants will be identified using several sources: REF and UKRI databases summarising research impact and direct involvement with UK CAN policy. The 2014 and 2021 REF (Research Excellence Framework) provide self-reported summaries of impact from UK universities and contain a number of references to influencing CAN policy. Similarly, UKRI Gateway to Research offers [when the database is fixed] a means to identify research that has policy-influence. From these, I will identify specific projects, and thus scientists, who have worked to influence UK public policy on climate change mitigation. I will extend this list of scientists by identifying those who have specifically worked with the UK Climate Change Committee, for instance in developing Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) for the UKâ€™s carbon budgets.


Began asking about participants motivation for getting involved in their science to understand whether its the science of the application of the science that is of interest

Also asked what they would like to see as an outcome of their efforts - a prod if you like at "what does success look like"
