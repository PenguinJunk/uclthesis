Participants will be identified using several sources: REF and UKRI databases summarising research impact and direct involvement with UK CAN policy. The 2014 and 2021 REF (Research Excellence Framework) provide self-reported summaries of impact from UK universities and contain a number of references to influencing CAN policy. Similarly, UKRI Gateway to Research offers [when the database is fixed] a means to identify research that has policy-influence. From these, I will identify specific projects, and thus scientists, who have worked to influence UK public policy on climate change mitigation. I will extend this list of scientists by identifying those who have specifically worked with the UK Climate Change Committee, for instance in developing Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) for the UKâ€™s carbon budgets.
