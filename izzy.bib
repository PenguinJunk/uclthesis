- knowledge (use v ignore)
- legitimacy (desirable v feasible)

(its ``anatomy of purposefulness''), each having a 
- stakeholder

- difficulty

- SOURCES OF MOTIVATION
1. Client - Who is (ought to be) the client or beneficiary? That is, whose interests are (should be) served?
2. Purpose- What is (ought to be) the purpose? That is, what are (should be) the consequences?
3. Measure of improvement - What is (ought to be) the measure of improvement or measure of success? That is, how can (should) we determine that the consequences, taken together, constitute an improvement?
- SOURCES OF POWER
4. Decision-maker- Who is (ought to be) the decision-maker? That is, who is (should be) in a position to change the measure of improvement?
5. Resources - What resources and other conditions of success are (ought to be) controlled by the decision-maker? That is, what conditions of success can (should) those involved control?

9. Guarantee - What or who is (ought to be) assumed to be the guarantor of success?

- SOURCES OF LEGITIMATION (those affected)
10. Witness - Who is (ought to be) witness to the interests of those affected but not involved? That is, who is (should be) treated as a legitimate stakeholder, and who argues (should argue) the case of those stakeholders who cannot speak for themselves, including future generations and non-human nature?
11. Emancipaton - What secures (ought to secure) the emancipation of those affected from the premises and promises of those involved? That is, where does (should) legitimacy lie?
12. Worldview - What worldview is (ought to be) determining? That is, what different visions of `improvement' are (should be) considered, and how are they (should they be) reconciled?

Legitimacy is primarily gained by those outside a system who are negatively affected by it. But the more you sweep in these interests you may expand the system bringing in a new system - a further boundary system.},

Asks about the nature of power, how it persists, why subordinates comply, why willingly, particularly in capitalism. 

Introduction is a superb overview of work into power and worth returning to to slot ideas and authors into a bigger picture:
- C. Wright Mills
- Floyd Hunter
- Alan Wolfe
- Robert Dahl (Who Governs?)
- Schumpeter
- Bachrach and Baratz (BachrachB1962)
- Schattschneider
- Antonio Gramsci (Hegemony)
- Anderson / Althusser / Femia
- Przeworski
- Tilly
- Michel Foucault

- elite power
- pluralism
- second face of power (nondecisionmaking)
- Gramsci's hegemony - and its interpretations: cultural/psychological consent v material interests
- Reaganism and Thatcherism
- neo-liberalism
- third dimension of power ``the power to prevent people to whatever degree from having grievances by shaping their preceptions, cognition and preferences in such a way that they accept their role in the existing order of things''

Tilly provides a checklist of all the answers to the question of why comply?:
1. actually rebelling continually (e.g. Scott1986)
2. get something in return (Gramsci + Przeworski)
3. gain some other value such as esteem or identity (Gramsci + Anderson / Althusser / Femia)
4. mystification, repression, unavailability of alternatives (3rd dimension of power)
5. force and inertia (coercion)
6. cost of resistance and rebellion (scant resources)
7 all of the above

Chapter 1 - virtually unaltered version of the original
Chapter 2 - considers
- the debate around power
- if it is a necessary concept
- considers the ultra-radical response to the original questions that is Foucalt's answer that domination is everywhere
Chapter 3 - identifies the mistakes in chapter 1 and elaborates on its answer

I've not read the 3 chapters but would be worth returning to (perhaps 2021 edition) to explore more on theories of power},

``inquires into the conditions and consequences of the project form, asking: how have norms and practices of project making shaped historical formations, social environments, and our understanding of them? In answering this question, the essay contextualizes the project form within a history of the modern world system. It then develops a theory of the project form, illustrating how the logistical and visionary aspects of projects emerge as effects of genre-mediated processes of project making. Finally, the essay considers how social theories that are blind to the project form risk naturalizing its logics. Through these steps, the essay reflects on the limits and limitations of the project form''},

Here we express them in terms of numbers of people left outside the `human climate niche'--defined as the historically highly conserved distribution of relative human population density with respect to mean annual temperature. We show that climate change has already put ~9\% of people (>600 million) outside this niche. By end-of-century (2080-2100), current policies leading to around 2.7 °C global warming could leave one-third (22-39\%) of people outside the niche. Reducing global warming from 2.7 to 1.5 °C results in a ~5-fold decrease in the population exposed to unprecedented heat (mean annual temperature ≥29 °C). The lifetime emissions of ~3.5 global average citizens today (or ~1.2 average US citizens) expose one future person to unprecedented heat by end-of-century. That person comes from a place where emissions today are around half of the global average. These results highlight the need for more decisive policy action to limit the human costs and inequities of climate change.},

The  the most cited RAI principles Jobin et al. [2019]:

- Technical Robustness and Safety
- Privacy and Data Governance

Find these are mostly all addressed in the frameworks

- Principle
- Guidelines
- Tool
- Other

Find mostly principles and guidelines but few practical tools

Find frameworks from:
- Companies
- Universities
- Non-profit organisations

Consider how much each applies across the software development lifecycle (SDLC):
- Requirements elicitation
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment

I have asked for full data on ResearchGate)

Findings:
- frameworks are provided by heterogenous entities leading to diversity of perspectives but little consensus or standardisation
- few frameworks cover the whole of teh SDLC or have practical support for practioners or tools for stakeholders or auditing
- there is no comprehensive framework `` whose knowledge can be
navigated and exploited by different kinds of stakeholders (technical and non-technical ones), which can simplify and
speed up the adoption of RAI practices''

China has experienced ``urbanization of place'' rather than ``urbanization of people'' by appropriating and developing large swaths of land

In situ urbanisation
Human-centred urbanisation

Increased physical presence of the state ``Recent studies demonstrate that the Chinese state maximizes the efficiency of coercive institutions by locating them where potential threats to regime stability are suspected''

studies find ``Modernized high-rise buildings represent a totally different economic and social milieu. While, in the past, access to land would guarantee a high level of self-reliance for food and other daily necessities, these formerly rural residents now must rely on commercial transactions to obtain their staples, leading to an immediate increase in the cost of living''

Findings:
1. urbanization encourages the expansion of the state: a greater increase in state infrastructure per capita is observed in newly urbanized areas than in potential sites of urbanization
2. the four types of state institutions show distinct patterns of relationship with neighborhood well-being: the presence of administrative infrastructure is positively associated with neighborhood satisfaction, the presence of coercive infrastructure is negatively associated with neighborhood satisfaction, whereas the association between the presence of legal or fiscal infrastructure and neighborhood satisfaction is not significant

the positive association between administrative infrastructure and neighborhood satisfaction can be partially attributed to the fact that residents and neighborhoods also have better access to public services where there are more government administrative agencies},

Why do inequalities in mobility and access matter?
- Transport can be a key barrier to employment
- Lack of transport can reduce access to education and training opportunities
- Limited transport options reduce access to healthcare
- Inadequate transport limits access to shops and services
- Spatial variations in accessibility to key services
- Lack of transport leads to social isolation
- Cost of transport constrains access to key activities
- Forced car ownership can lead to economic stress
- Disadvantaged road users are at higher risk of injury and death
- Health risks and environmental impacts of transport

Differences in travel across social groups
- Car owners and drivers are most travel included overall
- Lower income households travel less overall
- Gender differences are declining
- Disabled people are still constrained in their travel options
- Employment status still dominates people's travel activities
- Household structure is also a key factor in determining levels of travel
- Where people live makes a significance difference to their car access patterns
- being in a lower income group, experiencing a mobility difficulty, being a younger adult (aged 17-29) and being retired or long-term sick all act to suppress people's travel behaviours
- drivers trips and bus use are decreasing except in lower income group, walking is declining across all groups, cycle trips is increasing except in middle-income quintile, lowest income group becoming more reliant on taxis 

Also looks at future trends:
- Demographic projections
- Inequalities in Mobility and Access in the UK Transport System
- Housing and settlement patterns
- Income inequalities and poverty projections
- Health inequalities

Part of the confusion is the lack of clarity about the role and delivery of city infrastructures and its relationship to livelihood and livability. To address this issue, a framework for soft and hard city infrastructures has been developed using results from two case studies to model the relationships, conflicts and connections between soft and hard infrastructures. The first case study concerns the abandonment of a planned urban regeneration project for the Italian City of Lucca in Tuscany where institutional inertia prevented regeneration of a derelict tobacco factory. The second case study concerned results from data analysis of contributions for a public consultation exercise for City of Christchurch in New Zealand. The syntactic data analytics using Flax software coupled with data visualisation demonstrated how an urban narrative can be constructed about citizen priorities based on a framework for soft and hard city infrastructures. The methodology enables citizen engagement through cultivating open processes of urban exploration that advocate `connected infrastructures' thinking.},

Main research question: 
What happens when managers engage with design to achieve change in public sector organizations?

I've only read the abstract and introduction

p6:
Interviews managers in public sector to understand their experiences and outomces - most/all are newcomers to design. Finds activites are along 3 dimensions:
- Exploring the problem space
- Generating alternative scenarios
- Enacting new practices

p6-7:
And there are 6 types of engagement:
1. Questioning assumptions
2. Leveraging empathy
3. Stewarding divergence
4. Navigating the unknown
5. Making the future concrete
6. Insisting on public value

p7-8:
``Managers who use design approaches seem inclined toward governance that, in comparison to historical public management approaches, is more:
- Relational
- Networked
- Interactive
- Reflective

more emphasis on future making [like HillC2019 considering the desired outcome?]

Introduction expresses how the use of design approaches to public sector innovation can be transformational not only the service but to the public sector manager. That design approaches are being embedded explicitly in public sector organisations (innovation labs, i-teams, etc). This may be because of financial pressures and growing wicked problems.

Also an emerging understanding of the fluidity of institutions and roles within them p22

However, literature on innovation of public services is under-developed, perhaps partly because its based on product rather than service innovation and partly because it doesn't sufficiently account for the characteristics of the public sector p23

Asks lots of questions p24-5

``Design is thus still largely an unexplored, marginal phenomenon that may hold important lessons - academically and operationally - for the agenda of innovation in the public sector and (wider still) the question of how to intentionally generate societal change''},

Chapter 1 ``What is design?'':
``the conscious effort to impose meaningful order''
There are many different answers to design questions, none is right but some may seem better than others

Can't separate form and function, or claim form follows function ``aesthetic value is an inherent part of function''

6 inherent parts of design:
1. METHOD: The interaction of tools, processes, and materials (e.g. what is to hand shapes culture and tradition of design)
2. USE: `Does it work?'
3. NEED: neglected in favour of more profitable `wants'
4. TELESIS: use of nature and society to obtain goals, and also seems to be about how design influences nature and society
5. ASSOCIATION: psychological conditioning, some personal, some universal
6. AESTHETICS 

Also, designers often attempt to go beyond the primary functional requirements of method, use, need, telesis, association, and aesthetics; they strive for a more concise statement: precision, simplicity - sometime termed elegance},

The problem was indeterminate, could always go deeper for another cause, and there weren't true or false answers, only better solutions. Also implemented solutions leave ``traces'' that couldn't be undone. Early in his career he called design ``planning'' - the planning of complex systems, environments and tools. It was only when planning was seen as top-down rationalism that he used ``design''more.

Rittel teamed up with Melvin M. Webber to define wicked problems, that could never be subject to a single process of resolution.

``this paper explores how a more designerly approach can better support design researchers to undertake qualitative research within design studies''

``qualitative account of a design project which included 10 design teams developing new solutions with companies [meta design] ... service design elements were infused in data collection, data analysis and report of the phenomena'' - 5 teams each on product design and service design approaches, exploring how they can be enganced with product-service system (PSS) design components [this is an approach the authors have previously developed].

``Design studies can involve the use of qualitative research methods from social sciences ... However, as the amount of complexity and heterogeneous sets of data are being collected within design studies, traditional social science qualitative methods may be limitative for design researchers''

``Field notes included rich information including thick description of the situation observed, as well as sketches representing certain moments''

Resulting data were messy so were organised onto a board - columns are the projects rows are the design stages (exploration, creation, test and prototype and implementation). This was thus a visual representation of the data - could see where there are gaps needing further research. 

``Each evidence was colour coded to keep track of the type of source (e.g. interviews were in yellow, field notes in blue, pictures in white), and the parallel representation of the different evidences facilitated the analytic analysis of the phenomena under study''

This allowed observations cross-cutting the cases to be made, such as product-design tended to use physical models and service design more abstract models.

Say that this designerly approach to qualitative research is a new instrument to bridge the gap between design researchers and practitioners.},

Excellent table summarising Ethical initiatives and harms addressed. Predates the Turing AI Ethics work, however. From these, 12 harms and concerns are identified: 
1. Human rights and well-being
2. Emotional harm
3. Accountability and responsibility
4. Security, privacy, accessibility, and transparency
5. Safety and trust
6. Social harm and social justice
7. Financial harm
8. Lawfulness and justice
9. Control and the ethical use - or misuse - of AI
10. Environmental harm and sustainability
11. Informed use
12. Existential risk

For dataset consumers, the primary objective is to ensure they have the information they need to make informed decisions about using a dataset ... datasheets may be valuable to policy makers, consumer advocates, individuals whose data is included in those datasets, and those who may be impacted by models trained or evaluated on those datasets.

''We found that product teams were more likely to answer questions about legal and ethical considerations if they were integrated into sections about the relevant stages of the dataset creation rather than grouped together. Following feedback from external counsel, we removed questions explicitly asking about compliance with regulations, and introduced factual questions intended to elicit relevant information about compliance without requiring dataset creators to make legal judgments''.

Provides two example model cards that show some specific evaluation of bias quantification in models.

''It seems unlikely, at least in the near term, that model cards could be standardized or formalized to a degree needed to prevent misleading representations of model results (whether intended or unintended). It is therefore important to consider model cards as one transparency tool among many, which could include, for example, algorithmic auditing by third-parties (both quantitative and qualitative), “adversarial testing” by technical and non-technical analysts, and more inclusive user feedback mechanisms''.

My early thoughts - under metrics - any records of metrics that we've developed 
Under ethics - reference to LOCUS Charter principles and Ethical Explorer harms

Review of Model Cards after a could of yaers https://ecstaticnate.medium.com/aicards-a-companion-in-ai-ethics-documentation-1ad72bb40f1:
''The majority of projects that have Model Cards have also largely missed the spirit of the framework: ethical limitations, stakeholders, or population-based effects are typically missing from the documentation''

1. the scientific community is a political community
2. science plays a role in politics outside the laboratory
3. there is a conditional relationship between the polity of scientists and the wider polity (p. 332). 

Similarly, Latour (2007), Nahuis and Van Lente (2008), and Papadopoulos (2010) each identify five ways that science is political, and Bijker (2006) finds no fewer than seven ways that technology is political''

  abstract         = {Sentiment analysis from text consists of extracting information about opinions, sentiments, and even emotions conveyed by writers towards topics of interest. It is often equated to opinion mining, but it should also encompass emotion mining. Opinion mining involves the use of natural language processing and machine learning to determine the attitude of a writer towards a subject. Emotion mining is also using similar technologies but is concerned with detecting and classifying writers emotions toward events or topics. Textual emotion-mining methods have various applications, including gaining information about customer satisfaction, helping in selecting teaching materials in e-learning, recommending products based on users emotions, and even predicting mental-health disorders. In surveys on sentiment analysis, which are often old or incomplete, the strong link between opinion mining and emotion mining is understated. This motivates the need for a different and new perspective on the literature on sentiment analysis, with a focus on emotion mining. We present the state-of-the-art methods and propose the following contributions: (1) a taxonomy of sentiment analysis; (2) a survey on polarity classification methods and resources, especially those related to emotion mining; (3) a complete survey on emotion theories and emotion-mining research; and (4) some useful resources, including lexicons and datasets.},

``Just as we have no memory of how we acquired language and began to use and be shaped by it, we have no memory of how we began to use and be shaped by design. This makes it extremely difficult to imagine how things could be otherwise''

``Unsustainability is a core theme in the work of Tony Fry, an extraordinarily prolific author on the subject of design, politics and the environment since the late 1980s. One of the most vocal proponents of ontological design theory, much of his output has focused on the dialectical agency of design as both a `futuring' activity — that extends possibilities for the prospering of life on earth — and a `defuturing' one — that instead reduces those prospects by causing severe social and environmental harm, thus `taking the future away'.''

Had a great history of Participatory design in latter sections

Section ``Designers: Who Gets (Paid) to Do Design?'':
all human beings thus participate in design Papanek - but who gets paid to design?

``Professional design jobs in nearly all fields are disproportionately allocated to people who occupy highly privileged locations within the matrix of domination. At the same time, the numerous expert designers and technologists who are not wealthy and/or educationally privileged white cis men have often been ignored, their labor appropriated, and their stories erased from the history of technology'' (Wajcman 1991; and see Chanda Prescod-Weinstein's ``Decolonising Science Reading List'' at \url{https://medium.com/@chanda/decolonising-science-reading-list-339fb773d51f}; see also Beatrice Martini's ``Decolonizing Technology: A  Reading List'' at url{https://beatricemartini.it/blog/decolonizing-technology-reading-list}.)

``full parity remains unlikely without macro policy shifts to support systems-wide equalizers such as universal family policies, job protection, generous paid parental leave, child care services, and other key factors that are known to support gender-diverse employment, retention, and career advancement'' (Kushi and McManus 2016)

Section ``Diversity Is Good for Capitalist Profitability''
``employee diversity ... remains comfortably within the discourse of (neo)liberal multiculturalism and entrepreneurial citizenship'' (Irani 2015) ``despite steadily increasing interest in establishing a diverse pool of designers, developers, product managers, and other tech workers ... structural inequality is rarely mentioned, let alone challenged''

Section ``Imagined Users: Whose Tech?'':
``There is nothing wrong with making things people want. It's just that too little attention is being paid to the things people need'' (Penny 2014)

Section `User-Centered Design, the ``Unmarked'' User, and the Spiral of Exclusion'':
``Research shows that unless the gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, age, nationality, language, immigration status, and other aspects of user identity are explicitly specified, even diverse design teams tend to default to imagined users who belong to the dominant social group'' (Hamraie 2013)

Section: ``Design Justice and Lead User Innovation''
``Von Hippel demonstrates that information asymmetry between manufacturers and users is one of the underlying forces that supports lead user innovation. In a nutshell, when the cost (in time and energy) of communicating a specific kind of user need to the manufacturer is high, it often makes more sense for users to modify products on their own than to attempt to convince manufacturers to do so ... [but] does not engage with race, gender, class, or other axes of structural inequality''

Section ``Participatory Design'':
``In Scandinavia, the field of participatory design (PD) was created by trade unionists working with software developers such as Kristen Nygaard. They hoped to redesign industrial processes, software interfaces, and workplace decision-making structures'' (Gregory 2003)

``Asaro (2000) traces the roots of PD to the Norwegian Industrial Democracy Project (NIDP). In the 1960s, Scandinavian designers and researchers were concerned with the ways that the introduction of new technology in a workplace is often used to eliminate jobs, deskill workers, and otherwise benefit the interests of owners and managers over the interests of workers''

``The Nordic approach to PD is also characterized by an emphasis on the normative value of democratic decision making in the larger technological transformation of work, not only the microlevel pragmatic benefits of improved user interface design. However, in the US context, this broader concern is often lost in translation. Here, PD has sometimes (at worst) been reduced to an extractive process to gather new product ideas'' (Byrne and Alexander 2006)

``... These approaches certainly increase end user input into key design decisions, but most of them have little to say about community accountability, ownership, profit sharing, or credit for innovation''

Section ``Design Justice as Community Organizing'':
``Design justice practitioners choose to work in solidarity with and amplify the power of community-based organizations. This is unlike many other approaches to PD, in which designers partner with a community but tend to retain power in the process: power to convene and structure the work, to make choices about who participates, and, usually, to make key decisions at each point. Analysis of political power in the design process -- who sits at the table, who holds power over the project, what decision-making process is used -- will be fundamental to the successful future articulation of design justice in theory and practice.''

Excellent sections on ``Disability Justice and Queer Crip Design'' and ``\#MoreThanCode: Findings from the Technology for Social Justice Project''

``Community-driven design means that communities get to make critical decisions throughout the process; along the way, this approach helps community members develop technical knowledge and skills''

T4SJ Project synthesized hundreds of concrete suggestions for community accountability into the following recommendations:
- Adopt codesign methods
- Develop specific, concrete mechanisms for community accountability
- Center community needs over tools
- Invest in education (both formal and informal) that teaches codesign methods to more practitioners
- Create tech clinics, modeled on legal clinics
- Avoid `parachuting' technologists into communities
- Stop reinventing the wheel!
- Support maintenance, not just `innovation'},

  comment          = {Introduction to what Udoewa calls ``radical participatory design'' (rpd) using radical meaning ``from the root'', indicating that it is participatory from the top to the bottom

participatory design - design with potential users or even other stakeholders

rpd - not just design with by design by, with meta-methodology (not simply methods or methodologies) and with the community:
- the community is always present and always leading
- community members outnumber professional designers
- community members own the outcomes / artifacts and the narratives around these

Reason for participatory design may be:
- improve design outcomes
- mutual learning
- justice or democratic purpose
- change after design because participation leads to ownership by the community

Considers epistemologies and ontologies and how they relate to design

Epistemologies - ways of knowing - have been dominated by Western ideas, especially post-enlightenment, around institutional knowledge, which may be thought of as 3rd person. But there is also 1st person and 2nd person (interrelational, e.g. culture, spiritual) knowledge, and these may also break down further to different types such as embodied knowing, intuitive knowing, aesthetic knowing etc. All these are types of expertise, e.g. lived experiential knowledge. [made me think of Beiner2023]

Ontologies - ways of being - again many have been lost during the enlightenment and by colonialisation of ways of being. We don't just have different world views, we have different worlds.

rpd is decolonial and indigenous - enabling many ways of knowing and of being

Within participatory design the dominant role is designer as facilitator - but it is impossible to get past the inherent power in this role

Roles within rpd:
- designer as community member, alongside all the other skills brought by community members
- community member as designer
- community member as facilitator, even if this requires gradual development to support members

rpd includes various methods, e.g.:
- participatory appraisal - identify what each community member brings
- future design
- positive deviance

communities may not want to be defined by what they lack but by what they bring},

- interaction with the community (for whom the design is `for')
- a specific method use as useability testing, interviews, etc
- a way of conducting a method
- a methodology or collection of methods or guiding principles
- something else, currently unknown

Goals of PD:
- mutual learning
- elicitingthe community's perspective
- ownership or facilitatingbetter outcomes and change
- interacting after launch

Criticisms of process evaluation, understanding of power, culture and other dynamics

``It would be epistemologically biased and supremacist to cite published critiques, preferring the written word, when communities have known and experienced these problems before they were ever written. So I am sharing a critique based on the experience of communities and projects of which I have been a part.''

``If designers invite community members to participate, they are reinforcing the power differential, the fact that they have the power to invite or not to invite. They have the power to choose who, when, where, how, and if to invite. All the choices are in their hands. The very act of `empowering' users or community members, reinforces the designer's own power to do so and the seeming lack of power community members have to participate in their own way on their own terms''

``I will call PD, which maintains and strengthens power imbalances between designers and community members, colonial participatory design (CPD). I will use the terms RPD, critical PD, relational PD, and postcolonial PD interchangeably.'' [post-(colonial) rather than postcolonial]

Defines and reviews colonialisation and literature on this - more than land can be colonised - and work on decolonising PR

Histories of PD and participatory research tend to only go back to 1970's or 1940's which is the colonial history of PD nad PR. Identifies examples of PD from oral histories, and archeaology and challenges the epistemology of PR

``community design is inherently participatory, and communities of humans have always engaged in PD processes for hundreds of thousands of years''

Developd a typology based on 3 dimensions, each with a range of involvement from the community and the designers:
1. Who initiates the work, and how much do they initiate?
2. Who participates, and how fully do they participate? all phases - research, synthesis, design, and implementation (but also there are meetings, decisions, and practice design that often happen without community)
3. Who leads the process, regardless of participation, and how much do they lead?

- Community design is wholly on the community end of all these dimensions
- Community driven-design is across the spectrum of dimension 1 (initiation), from wholly community to equally community and designer in terms of dimension 2 (participation), and wholly at the community end of dimension 3 (leadership)
- Colonial PD covers whole spectrim of dim 1, all of dim 2 that includes designer, and designer majority of dim 3
- RPD  covers whole spectrim of dim 1, the community majority halfs of both dim 2 and dim 3

Discusses in detail the 3 criteria of RPD:
- the community is always present and always leading
- community members outnumber professional designers
- community members own the outcomes / artifacts and the narratives around these},

Discussion of DT p112
Loosely human-centred
Inspired by the participatory philosophies of theorists such as Papanek and Manzini
Some say it is `bottom-up', narrowing the gap between designers and citizens
Iskander 2018 argues that DT privileges the designer ahead of those who are meant to be served by the process

Paper asks 3 questions:
1. what is really new about DT in the public sector?
2. how does it challenge or differ from more traditional approaches to policymaking?
3. what impact, if any, does it have on the process of policymaking?

and compare DT to rational-process and participatory models

Discussion of PSI Labs - vanguard of DT in public sector, focus of innovation

Policymaking is usually described as rational, sequential with known problems p114 Adams 2004: contemporary movement towards `evidence-based' policymaking is a species of scientism, posits verifiable social-scientific knowledge as the `modern currency of public policy' p116  emphasis on precision and closure p116

Alternatives to rational are interpretative and participatory models p115

``both problem construction and solution analysis is `intimately involved with relations of power' (FischerF1993 p7)

DT is abductive, iterative, p114 situated p116 playful, creative, illogical p115 open and ambiguous p116

```emotion and intuition' are treated as valid bases for determining viable options (Bason, 2013). This marks an important difference with deliberative approaches which, while recognising the importance of empathy in mobilising participants to gain mutual understanding, nevertheless privilege the `inherent rationality' (Renn2006: 35) of
argumentative persuasion as the basis for adjudicating options''

Analyse:
- the methods used by PSI labs (e.g. a few use RCTs, many use citizen/stakeholder engagement through workshops, etc)
- the design levels (e.g. a few engage in developing policy proposals or reforms, many consult with stakeholders)
- stages of the innovation cycle worked at (e.g. a few evaluate programmes/trials/pilots, most generate ideas)},

  abstract         = {{The purpose of this article is to highlight meta-ethnography—the interpretive synthesis of ethnographic studies on a given theme—as a useful tool in the study of social policy and public administration. We claim this approach can maximize the impact of rich idiographic research to enable theory-refining and evidence-building efforts in the field. We illustrate these benefits through reference to a worked example focused on public encounters with social security in advanced liberal democracies. We show how we drew together 49 ethnographic studies from a variety of disciplines to identify repertoires of response that citizens exercise in their encounters with the contemporary welfare state. Through this analysis, we demonstrate how meta-ethnography can shed new light on topical contemporary debates about administrative burden. We conclude by reflecting on the prospects and limits of this technique for broader use in the field.}},
  comment          = {Argues for rich interpretative synthesis over ethnographic work, which is currently ``conceived and practiced as a one-shot (usually “lone wolf”) activity, and is not geared at producing data amenable to reutilization by the wider research community'' for public administration

Benefits of meta-ethnography:
1.  particular tolerance for heterogenous data can link the (often) small numbers of studies in policy and administration to those emerging in a host of cognate disciplines which engage with similar problems and questions
2. exploratory orientation - underpinned by a ``logic of discovery'' - can also elicit powerful new understandings
3. confront the perception that ethnographic research has a short shelf-life and fails to generate an empirical legacy amenable to systematic reutilization
4. keep ethnographic studies relevant even as topical discussions and theoretical debates in the field evolve

``Meta-ethnography entails the creative and generative process of identifying, reading, relating, and translating studies of similar phenomena into one another. It is an approach to synthesizing the insights from published research that shares a commitment to an ``ethnographic sensibility'' and the exploratory orientation underpinned by a ``logic of discovery''''

``It involved uncovering patterns through tracing explicit cross-references and recurring tropes, resonant quotes, and familiar anecdotes across each ``thick description.''''

``It is not painting by numbers, searching by keywords, scanning abstracts for findings, extracting insights free of context''

Noblit and Hare's 7-step framework: 
1. getting started (what we already know, talking to researchers, etc)
2. deciding what is relevant to the initial interest 
3. reading the studies 
4. determining how the studies are related 
5. translating the studies into one another 
6. synthesizing the translation 
7. presenting the synthesis

But conducting a meta-ethnography does not entail a linear or ``stepwise'' approach

However, this paper assesses each step for its strengths, challenges and identifies practical strategies

e.g. drawbacks:
- reading and iterative discovery entails greater investment than typical literature review
- second hand knowledge of the studies is shallower than first-hand experience
- ``meta-ethnography frees interpretive analysts up from concerns about exposing “raw” data, but it does not wash our hands of ethical responsibility for how we choose to identify stories, retell them, and draw out their implications''

Bases a worked example on HerdM2018's work on administrative burden

``Our emphasis was on studies that foregrounded the beliefs and experiences of citizens in their encounters with social security in rich detail''

Abductive process, identified three key dilemmas which link to HrdM2018's costs of learning, complance and psychological costs:
- how to navigate complex rules
- how to avoid sanctions
- how to save face

Found three broad groups of responses ``repertoires'':
- dissent
- dissociation
- personalization

For these there were sets of consequences},

Decolonising technologies, including AI, such as drawing from indigenous knowledge p67 ``designers Lewis, Arista, Pechawis, and Kite draw from Hawaiian, Cree, and Lakota knowledge to argue that indigenous epistemologies, which tend to emphasize relationality and “are much better at respectfully accommodating the non-human,” should ground the development of AI''

Chapter 2: Practices

The ``participatory turn'' in technology design, has become
increasingly popular over time in many subfields of design theory and
practice, including: p88
- participatory design (PD)
- user-led innovation
- user-centered design (UCD)
- human-centered design (HCD)
- inclusive design
- codesign

Good summary of PD and related approaches p85-88. P88:
- codesign, often used as an umbrella that includes various
approaches to PD and HCD.  

Created by trade unionists in Scandinavia (p86) motivated primarily by an interest in empowering users, but also by a concern to build systems better suited to user needs

Power dynamics results in different levels of capacity to participate e.g. ``workers participating in a PD meeting with managers at the table may not feel comfortable saying what they mean or sharing their full experience ... gender inequality shapes participation in design processes ... PD processes may actually normalize cultural violence ... they subordinate beliefs and practices not in line with those who manufacture discourse and manipulate media and technology systems to maintain their power and privilege'' p88-9

Community knowledge extraction with designers maintaining (community does not have): p90
- ownership
- profit
- credit
- visibility

Figure illustrating how degree of community participation can fluctuate over the design process, with some phases (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test) have more participation than others, depending on the work being done p91

Emergent Strategy - communities, e.g. those who are marginalised, are already designing their solutions p92

Recommendations: p98-9
- Adopt codesign methods
- Develop specific, concrete mechanisms for community accountability
- Center community needs over tools
- Invest in education (both formal and informal) that teaches codesign methods to more practitioners
- Create tech clinics, modeled on legal clinics

- Avoid ``parachuting'' technologists into communities
- Stop reinventing the wheel!
- Support maintenance, not just ``innovation''

Design narratives p109
- who receives attention and credit
- How problems and challenges are framed
- How solutions are scoped
- What stories we tell about design processes

Chapter 3: Narratives

Loads on technologies designed my activist communities and social movements p107-20

Argues for asset based approach. Discusses problem framing. Expert designers the norm is regular deviation. Design is not linear. Iterative and satisficing. p121

Really powerful section on affect of framing/scoping of problems... Foreclosure of political context of problem. Commitments to technological determinism and techno social progress leave little room for the political and historical. Decoupling design problems from structure and systems of oppression. Eg Ways that algorithms are used to reproduce white supremacy,... and settler colonialism is reduced to a critique of algorithmic bias p122-3

Design Justice provides tools to analyse problem statements. Centres analysis on how design affects the unequal distribution of benefits and burden to groups in matrix of domination. Exploring questions modifies assumptions in problem statements. There are several alternative formulations of a problem.

And what does the framing imply about the context?

``This failure is produced by a techno-solutionist orientation (new technology will save us!), an exclusionary and elitist understanding of what technology is and where it comes from (smart scientists in university and corporate laboratories), and a lack of interest in preexisting, community-based design practices'' p128

Chapter 4: Sites

Hackerspaces originally politicised counter cultural sources and there are still plenty of examples hacking for social movements around the world, e.g. Latin America

Innovation labs increasingly popular. Examples of city innovation labs where public invited in such as improving government administration and life. But research shows that elite participation is the norm. Limited to elite concerns.

CIO and chief digital officer into public sector from private sector bringing in private sector culture. Neoliberal techno centric ideas about the city as a machine or as a software system waiting to be optimise have become increasingly prominent. Citizens reduced to the status of users. Top down innovation spaces can feel forced not building on local context but rather globalised etc one world ontology p149-50

Great criticism of civic innovation and participatory design processes approaches - ``often neoliberal code for the continued shrinkage of the social welfare state ... Participatory design processes are too often used to generate community-created materials that provide cover for the underlying assumption that the private sector can do everything better, cheaper, and more efficiently'' p152

discotechs discovering technology

Hackathons
Creating new stuff has kudos. Maintaining and improving existing ones stress not. Attribution, credit and visibility for developers of something new. Solutionist approach. Problem based as opposed to asset based framing.

Hackathons often experience of sexism

What is needed is a democratic consensus, strong social movements and policy. Ignorant of work already done.

Other kappa coefficients are not suitable either and calls for more robust evaluation metrics.

Disagreement is high in argumentation and it tends to require expertise to label. However, crowdsourcing is still of value because it is important to consider how real people understand arguments.

Compare crowdsource data to data from an in-house expert group to understand where crowdsourced disagreement may emerge - which is summarised as ``there was a tendency to assume the intentions of the speakers,instead of focusing on the arguments themselves''. This is detailed in examples from Donald Trump and Joe Biden in the appendices.

  comment          = {Considers the outcomes of 10 studies and finds only a small effect of gender inequality in deliberation. However, they also found this gap is highly sensitive to circumstances and status of different genders. Considers the inequality affects in some settings may be ``washed out'' by more equal settings elsewhere. Inequality is however statistically significantly predicted by urbanity.

``One of the constraints on any effect of critical mass is that reaching a threshold of women will not necessarily change the workings of an institution. The formal and informal rules that govern our democracies work to produce inequalities in both outcomes and processes, in other words the `rules of the game' matter as much as being included in the game (Childs and Krook 2009; Celis and Childs 2020)''

``Verdict-driven deliberation has been argued to be a more male type of deliberation while evidence-driven is associated with female styles (Sanders, 1997)''

Decision rules make a difference
`` Karpowitz et al., (2012) found that to offset the gender difference in a group discussion, increasing the number of women is not sufficient. Instead in a mixed group, a unanimity rule helps to create a dynamic discussion where women scale up their equal share of conversation'' and majority rule leads to equal engagement with discussion if women are the majority in the group.},

  comment          = {``While all policies appear to involve some level of design, there are at the same time degrees to which design is involved'' p19

``Jan Tinbergen (1958, 3) ... argued, design ... was an alternative to ``decisions taken on the basis of a general idea of progress and often somewhat haphazardly'' ''

Ideas of design in policy making date back to mid 20th century

``can we develop templates for interventions that can have utility beyond a narrow range of issues and a narrow range of contexts? Or should we be more concerned with specific designs for specific issues rather than assuming that we can develop generic designs?''

``a good deal of ideological thinking about policy that assumes that a simple world view can provide policy guidance ,,, tends to eschew evidence in favor of commitment, and to assume that complex policy problems can be solved through relatively simple solutions ... in marked contrast to the emphasis on “evidence” and policy learning in much of the contemporary academic literature on public policy (Pawson, 2006)''

The main point returned to several times in this chapter is that design is a conscious effort

Argues that design for policy is different to other design in that that the objects if that design - people and organisations - not not necessarily behave as expected. ``individual behavior is the ultimate target of most policy design'' p9

Bobrow 2007 lists 10 principles of policy design:
1. discipline breakout
2. minimum conditions
3. safeguards
4. placement (time)
5. oppositional analysis
6. borrowing
7. tinkering
8. backward mapping
9. forward mapping
10. judgement

``some weaknesses of designing in the public sector arise because of failure to involve the range of actors influenced by the policy'' Who to include? - problem framing is essential

``must necessarily be concerned with fundamental human values'' but decision makers too often desguising this in utility calculations which discount e.g. the future p10

Policy design involves:
- values
- conflict
- targetting and modulation

Discusses types of policy design:
- programmes (these make up policy)
- ideological design (very common)
- political design - reflects contention between alternative designs and the outcome of a political process that chooses among them
- design by transfer - defusion of ideas, especially if evidence-based
- design by innovation - what many think of as design, but is difficult in policy - tends to be more participatory because there's an assumption that participation brings a wider range of ideas
- accidental and experimental design - or policy from bottom up - or something that occurs in a crisis - although most policy is actually accidental and experimentation is often ongoing but under the radar
- non-design - ``for public policy non-decisions are decisions'' - ``while designing policy is active, important policies persist because of the absence of that activity'' p20

Model of policy design originally published in the 1980s - design requires at least four elements: 
- an understanding of causation
- an understanding of instruments available to address the problem
- an explicit understanding of the values by which the outcomes of the policy should be evaluated
- a plan for intervention

Also, an understanding of the manner in which these four elements interact p21

This model combines into policy paradigms - ideas and standards that specify the goals of policy. There is a need to be cognizent of the paradigm and challenge it so as not to repeat mistakes.

Over time there has been an increase in the number of policy problems, an increase the the instruments and tools available to address this and thus an increase in the complexity of policy problems

Critiques of policy literature:
- narrow focus
- reactive style of designing
- narrow temporal considerations
- uncertainty and risk (inadqueate attention to)
- The tabula rasa - policy is created in an existing policy landscape with policy path dependence
- context
- instrumentalism (overemphasis on instruments)},

  comment          = {Discusses their (with Webler) approach to bringing together (termed ``co-operative discourse''):
- technical expertise - a necessary but not a sufficient condition to make prudent environmental decisions
- public values and preferences - to legitimise decisions
- rational decision making - implication from text (p35) that this is required to address biases, anecdotal evidence and false assumptions within public perceptions

Two objectives of their model of participation: p35
1. enhance the competence in decision-making
2. assign a fair share of responsibility to those affected

Structure in discursive processes assures integration of: p40
- technical expertise
- regulatory requirements
- public values

Keywords: p34
- trust-building
- community development
- co-determination

Deliberative / participatory approach overcomes flaws of decisionistic model of communication in which expert panel informs elected representatives who then make decisions based on public values, which relies on choice of concerns and values by the representatives. Ambiguity and dissent among experts and other factors. Affected groups demand that their values and preferences are taken into account. p40-1

A common platform for mutual exchange of ideas, arguments and concerns ``danger that each group trespasses its legitimate boundary of expertise. If perceptions replace assessments and the rhetoric of powerful agents replaces value input by those who have to bear the potential impacts, the discourse goes into the wrong direction'' p41

Largely about deliberation, the participatory nature of this is implied within the text. 

Defines and discusses deliberation. p35-7

Habermas and others consider it rational if all participants are required to: p35-6
- seek consensus
- articulate and criticise factual claims on the basis of scientific and other forms of problem-adequate knowledge
- interpret factual evidence using formal logic and analytical reasoning
- disclose relevant values and preferences
- process data, arguments and evaluations in a structured format

Habermas does not address rival rationalities in terms of power, influence and significance, which matters when considering who to select to participate.

Deliberation is needed to define and role and relevance for choice making of two forms of knowledge: p36
- systematic (scientifically derived)
- ideosyncratic (derived from experience and familiarity with local conditions)

Deliberation is also needed to: p36
- find the most appropriate way to deal with uncertainty
- set efficient and fair trade-off
- address wider concerns of affected groups

Deliberation can also: p36-7
- enhance understanding
- generate new options
- decrease hostility and aggressive attitudes among the participants
- explore new problem framing
- enlighten legal policy makers
- produce competent, fair and optimised solution packages
- facilitate consensus, tolerated consensus and compromise

Suggest early on that ``early involvement of the public in deliberative processes may compromise the objective of efficient and effective policy implementation or violate the principle of fairness'' p34

Co-operative Discourse has 3 steps: p37-8
1. Identification and selection of concerns and evaluative criteria - all relevant stakeholder groups to reveal their values and criteria for judging different options and these are organised using value-tree analysis
2. The identification and measurement of impacts and consequences related to different policy options - research team operationalise and transform into indicators the evaluative criteria in the value-tree using a Delphi process
3. Conducting a discourse with randomly selected citizens as jurors and representatives of interest groups as witnesses - panels of one or several groups of randomly selected citizens conducted as seminars over three to five consecutive days or over a longer period of up to 6 months

Alternative approach to this are described in: Chess and Purcell, 1999; Chess, 2000; Rowe and Frewer, 2000).

Tools: p38-9
- Value-tree analysis - identifies and organises the values of an individual or group with respect to possible decision options
- Multi-attribute utility (MAU) analysis - elicits values, criteria, and attributes and the assignment of relative weights to the different value dimensions - the participants are forced to reflect upon their opinions and search for potential hidden motives or values that might explain discrepancy between numerical model and their holistic judgements

Case studies: p39-40
- national energy policy in Germany in 1982 identified preferences from a range of pre-defined scenarios
- regional waste management planning in Black Forest in 1984-6 arrived at unanimous decision to site incinerators in the centre of most populated town in the region as a visual reminder of the need to reduce waste (recommendation still not accepted by date of this paper)
- siting of landfills in Switzerland - panels identified criteria for decisions, evaluate the data, eliminate sites for no further considerations, and prioritise suitability of remaining sites
- sewage sludge management in US - hard to tell what conclusions are from this except need to change US political culture},

Critiques representative democracy, all of which may lead to increase in populism:
- Size - existing governance structures are too large meaning promised goods and services cannot be delivered
- Remoteness - governance systems are too remote for the average citizen, citizens have `street-level' knowledge not possessed by officials who don't make appropriate decisions
- Displacement of goals - politicians acting according to their political needs rather than in a representative way
- Adversarial governance - especially Westminster systems resulting in conflict rather than consensus
- Depoliticisation - decisions being moved to non-political bodies (because adversarial decision making is obstructive) or just behind closed doors e.g. cabinet

Create a typology of populism along 2 dimensions (a third could be left to right):
1. democratic versus authoritarian
2. elite and participatory

Resulting types of populism, describes, exemplifies and critiques each:
- electoral populism - populist rhetoric (may not be populist once governing, i.e. moving to electorial authoritarianism)
- participatory democracy
  - referendums
  - deliberative democracy (Neblo 2015) (see conditions below)
- electorial authoritarianism - e.g. as a consequence of suspicion that political establishment is working against their demands 
- consultative authoritarianism - using consultative mechanisms, like referenda, to legitimate their agenda

Conditions that can be used to judge the extent to which any particular attempt at deliberative democracy corresonds to an `ideal type' model:
1. is process to produce a final decision or is it only advisory?
2. is discussion ongoing or a one-time change to express views?
3. are the participants selected to represent or can anyone participate? mentions inequality in weighting of different views in favour of certain groups (those with greater command of language)
4. is a full range of options available for deliberation or are they constrained a priori?},

Both very meta and interesting!

``Action scientists use the term `action' to signal a commitment to transforming practice through reflective internal critique, while we use the term `science' to signal a commitment to the principles, if not the practices, of traditional social science: `responsibility to the evidence, openness to argument, commitment to publication, loyalty to logic, and an admission, in principle, that one may turn out to be wrong' (Scheffler, 1982, p. 138)''

``I was repeatedly struck by the level of defensiveness he generated when seeking to explain and transform behavior that prevents learning at the individual and organizational levels, a primary cause being the glaring gap between what people espouse and how people behave''

``most people unknowingly held a theory-in-use they called Model I, which values seeking one's own purposes, staying rational, minimizing emotionality, and winning. At the same time, the vast majority of these people espoused a different theory called Model II, which values valid information, free and informed choice, and internal commitment to those choices''

When challenged on their Model I views, most were defensive and very few willing to consider developing themselves. This is therefore entirely counter to the aims of Action Science

``using espoused values to evaluate governing values across situations causes more defensiveness and less learning than observing how a person's framing of a particular situation limits her to acting one way and not others''

Therefore, develop and iterate a theory and practice to reduce defensiveness by
- replacing the idea of governing values by framing values
- having values evaluated as in-the-moment rather than tacit},

``Max Horkheimer (1972), one of the founders of the Frankfurt School of critical theory (Jay, 1973; Wiggershaus, 1994), described critical theory as a form of theorizing motivated by a deep concern to overcome social injustice and to establish more just social conditions for all people. He contrasted critical theory with `traditional theory', by which he meant positivistic science, what in this volume is referred to as conventional science, which aims to build scientific knowledge progressively by accumulating empirical knowledge of the world, assuming a distinction between facts and values. Critical theory, Horkheimer said, :

``has no specific influence on its side, except concern for the abolition of social injustice. … Its own nature … turns it towards a changing of history and the establishment of justice'' (Horkheimer, 1972: 242-43)

The notion of `critique' in critical theory means exploring `existing conditions' (Marx, 1967) to find how particular perspectives, social arrangements, or practices may have irrational, unsustainable, unjust, alienating, or inhumane consequences. The classical case is Marx's (1977) Capital  (first published in German 1867, first English edition 1887), his analysis of class relationships under capitalism that produced and reproduced the suffering of working-class people while at the same time producing and reproducing the advantages of ruling class people and groups. 

In critical participatory action research, participants aim to be `critical' in this way, to find how particular perspectives, arrangements and practices create untoward effects. Through critical participatory action research, they aim to change things so untoward consequences can be avoided, acting negatively against real and manifest irrationality, unsustainability, and injustice, rather than positively for some elusive ideal of what counts as rational, sustainable, or just.''},

``I want to explore here is the potential of combining design and futures approaches in (re)imagining public policy making, by (re)connecting people's experiences with policy infrastructures, processes and practices'' p129

Policy Labs and similar (open government) have developed new approaches, including: p130
- Evidence-based policy, premised on the idea of demonstrating ``what works''
- Broadening participation in developing policy and using a wider range of evidence
- Experimentation in policy making by trying out ideas before applying them at scale

``Having agency within a co-design workshop does not replace the need for having agency in your home, neighbourhood, place of study, play, worship, or work, in your communities or the wider world'' p129

Habegger (2010, p56) identifies two ways foresight activities contribute to public policy making: p131
1. systematic knowledge about trends and developments in the wider environment
2. mutual learning processes and networks created across professional communities and policy areas

``Bringing design into policy contexts brings a focus on the practical generation and exploration of new ideas that allow policy specialists to collaborate across silos and surface the perspectives of beneficiaries and citizens (Bason, 2014; Kimbell, 2015a)'' p131

``By providing a focus on outcomes, rather than solutions; creating systems that enable post-production, rather than stand-alone services; experimenting to produce the grounds for conviction; and by recognising and exercising a new type of authority that is distributed, rather than hierarchical. Thus as with futures expertise, design, too, has the potential to change policy making practice but is also hampered by deep-seated institutional norms and political realities (Bailey & Lloyd, 2016)'' p131

PFS, framework is a triangle, brings together: p132
- policy - assessment and understanding of risk, evidence based, implementation, accountabilities
- design - agile, experience-based, materialised, inventive
- futures - systemmatic, non-lineariry, network creating, mutual learning

Characteristics of the PFS:
- Publics and problems revealed as ``in the making'' p132
- Materialising potential futures as people experience them p132
- Zooming in and out p133
- Translating between different kinds of data and expertise p133

A third essential component of our framework is the ``window of opportunity'' embodying ``specific moments, modes and loci for action'' (Stirling, 2014, p. 7)'' p5

Discuss the different perspectives from different fields (International Relations, IR, and Science and Technology Studies STS) of how close expertise should be to decision making and whether expertise matters. In IR, the neorealist stream regards scientific advice as epiphenomenal and even dismiss the value of scientific advice. Haas writes about epistemic communities and the need to insulate them from political influence in order to matter. Whereas IR constructivist accounts draw attention to how the global problem of climate change was constructed [I guess: by science and policy not being separated?]. STS, with ideas such as boundary work, hybridization and coproduction, resists a separation between expert and policy.

``reject quasi-epiphenomenal, neorealist treatments of expertise ... emphasize that science-policy interfaces are crucial in promoting social learning among policymakers, which is necessary for policy formulation'' p11

``Cash et al. (2003) developed a theoretical framework based on the three pillars of credibility, relevance, and legitimacy (also known as CRELE)'' p3

``knowledge can only matter if it is widely accepted by policymakers'' p4

Dimensions of the framework developed:
- institutional design (deductively derived) - formal rules and procedures
- boundary work (deductively derived) - informal science-policy interplay
- window of opportunity (inductively derived) - that expertise can seize to influence policy-making

UNCCD is a similar, but less well known body, as IPCC and IPBES. It is ``unique in its embeddedness in a political convention'' p5-6

Gives examples of how the interaction in the SPI can help scientists learn how to communicate in ways that are useful p7

Finds that small size of UNCCD and its scientific founding are valuable - easier for more non-governmental voices to be heard. Bring in experts for specific areas as required p8

Also find that state power is counteractive - member states of the global north do not value the UNCCD, some were even manipulating its language p9

Whereas some member states in the global south were staunch supporters p10

3 broad challenges have emerged from global evaluation practice in relation to its contribution to public policies:
- Establishing what solutions work
- Explaining why solutions work (or not)
- Transferring research findings into policy actions

In terms of causality, there are various stances including:
- successionists - focus on analysing the direct association between a treatment and an observed outcome
- configurationists - pay attention to the attributes that lead to variations in outcomes
- generativists - focus on identifying the supporting factors underlying an observed causal relation

``By the end of the 1970s, the policy research community started to recognise the growing gap between the production of analyses and their incorporation into programme decision-making (Weiss, 1988)'' p94

Reasons for this: p94
- timing - ex-ante evaluations are late in the process
- differences - experts and policy-makers differ in terms of purposes, mindsets and languages
- organisations - they are bureaucratic and absorb information in complex, non-linear ways (punctuated equilibrium)

Categories of issues found in labs: p96
- structures
- functions
- processes

Found that ``labs' ambition to create meaningful change in these two areas [engaging citizens and changing the culture of government] has not been followed by a clear idea of what exact impact they are aiming at, nor a way to measure it'' p99

``policy labs are heavily based on design practice including design thinking and industrial design'' p100

It promises to bring universities and other knowledge organisations into line with new demands and opportunities. In this study, we have investigated drivers of change in the shifting landscape, and note disparate drivers that plot different courses for transdisciplinarity. We describe three drivers: `the knowledge economy', `the environmental imperative' and `the engaged populace'. We discuss their different prescriptions for transdisciplinary knowledge production and contradictions that arise from these, including tensions between consolidation and interconnection, and between knowledge commodification and mutual learning. In response, we suggest that rather than investing in knowledge `products', universities should focus on developing capacity for transdisciplinarity, and for knowledge production generally.},
  comment          = {Argue that commodification of knowledge endagers transdisciplinarity and knowledge production.

The shifting landscape of knowledge production:
- knowledge economy:

Knowledge economy emerging as feature of capitalism. Knowledge is seen as contributing to the economy by reshaping and adding value to existing industries and creating new industries. There is a reconceptualisation of knowledge as a commodity traded with knowledge consumers.

This is reflected in changes to university funding and incentives, ``third role'' to contribute to the economy and generate more funding for themselves and the ``corporatisation of universities'' - research priorities now being reorganized into a few research strengths and priority areas

Australian Cooperative Research Centre CRC is a response - universities with industry research partners

- environmental imperative:
Environmental imperative has seen more consideration of ideas of practice of transdisciplinarity

- engaged populace:
Education and knowledge are more socially distributed with www and higher amount of higher education

calls by Gibbons and co-workers for a shift to Mode 2 knowledge production, which is synonymous with transdisciplinarity]

``The tainting of some of the Mertonian norms of science - disinterestedness and objectivity - by values of the market and by the contingencies of application and past failings of science to adequately address complex and uncertain problems have also lead to challenges to the monopoly authority of science. This loss of authority, which has been described as a ``crisis of public confidence'', creates new opportunities for other sources of knowledge to gain legitimacy. This is supported by movements inside and outside academia challenging the dominance of scientific knowledge and promoting respect for diverse lay and indigenous knowledges. A lack of faith in the power of science to provide all the answers, or even to ask the right questions, has led to increasing demand for the public to be included in decision-making processes and for science to seek a `shared vision' or `contract' with the public'' [worth looking up refs in this section]

Engaged populace is a driver for transdisciplinarity

Where is the place of people in our knowledge?

``there are increasing demands for public participation in knowledge creation and policy deliberations, both from the bottom-up (i.e. from a more educated populace which lacks confidence in science) and from the top-down (i.e. from researchers and government who recognize the value of lay knowledge for decision quality). This translates into the need for an approach to knowledge production that is consultative, deliberative and participatory. This has given rise to the concept of mutual learning'' p464-5

Transdisciplinarity and multidisciplinary are seen as counter to formation of silos. But university consolidation with commercial incentives risks building mega silos. p465

``Transdisciplinarity is a practice that requires flexibility and fluidity. There are several ways in which attempts to institutionalise it may in fact inhibit it'': p466
1. mega-silos replace disciplinary boundaries with topic, technology and industry boundaries
2. institutions that have invested transdisciplinary approaches may be unresponsive to new problems - related to `paradox of density' which finds that innovation in a research area is proportionally greater when the area is new
3.  institutionalisation may detract from a knowledge production approach that provides interconnection, complexity and systems thinking e.g. interconnections between economic, environmental and social dimensions
4. can lead to reprioritisation around commercial agendas

Considers area of plant improvement - see what to commercialisable research but not in publications.

Contradictions and tensions:
- institutionalisation versus interconnection - ``institutionalisation threatening interconnection represents a tension between the `knowledge economy' perspective and the environmental imperative''
- knowledge commodification mutual learning - Commercialisation of knowledge and `resource extraction'
  - problem of power - privileging of particular types of knowledge
  - some scientists driven by knowledge economy and its opportunities, others fear threats to their autonomy

``Differences in intellectual property cultures, between academia and industry, but even more notably between formalised and lay or indigenous knowledge, leave open the prospect of exploitation of knowledge `resources' ''
Commodification of knowledge endagers transdisciplinarity and knowledge production - thus there is a need to build intellectual capacity in universities - . ``Strong intellectual capacity is therefore best served by combining disciplinarity and transdisciplinarity'' p469

Currently university ``culture is characterised by individuality, elitism, the accumulation of advantage (the Matthew effect) and academic territorialism associated with disciplines and specialisations'' p469-70},

key issue of representation: ``who participates and what values, perspectives and interests do these participants represent, and deliberation; how can all voices be voiced and included in a legitimate way''

biases towards elite actors are worrying because they result in these processes reproducing or even exacerbating existing inequalities. Elite actors (e.g. government, large NGOs, or scientists) are able to shape these processes to serve their interests because they:
- have more time and resources available
- often initiate these processes, define the scope for participation
- have more knowledge and skills
- better able to articulate a contribution that is considered relevant and important
- have strong authority that is attributed to scientific expertise vis-a-vis other knowledge systems p16
- often paid to participate as part of their professional roles, while the other participants are expected to volunteer their time
- more often invited to participate than unorganized citizens or less well-known groups

Further:
- inherent Western bias
- ongoing challenges of colonialism
- contexts characterized by conflict, and communities that are not able to self-organize nor given support by local decision-maker

Unequal power is often driven by depoliticisation which enforces norms in knowledge and communication which drives out other political interests, norms and values [- basically not mentioning the political elephant in the room -] Examples include ignore the lobbying effects of powerful interests.

Depoliticisation can be recognised as:
1. projects led by a rationale of science-driven impacts and do not challenge existing hierarchies between scientific and other knowledge holders
2. projects strive for consensus and for solutions that are considered rational according to elite perspectives, but which may cover up fundamental differences among participants in terms of stakes, power, access to resources, vulnerability, and risk
3. co-production stays confined to project boundaries without engaging the wider political context in which these projects are embedded

Basically questions that participatory processes are more democratically progressive than expert analysis given the dynamics of power around the processes of information and decision-making

Compare expert analysis to participatory deliberation and find parallels in terms of normative, substantive, and instrumental imperatives, sensitivity to framing conditions, justification, strategic behaviour and power. ``Yet, either approach may be undertaken and presented in such ways as alternatively conceal and reify, or acknowledge and interrogate, these pressures, sensitivities, and susceptibilities''

- appraisal is about informing
- commitment is about forming tangible social choices in the governance of science and technology

Discusses ``closing-down'' of appraisal, by which the range of outputs (e.g. different points of view) are reduced, and ``opening-up'', by which a greater number of elements and their ambiguities are delivered

Different frameworks and methods for fostering engagement with stakeholders and the public in the governance of science and technology include those that are described variously as: p263
- inclusive
- discursive
- deliberative
- pluralistic
- reflexive
- participatory

Technical ``progress'' is no longer linear, instead: p263
-  complex,  dynamic  pictures  of  contingency
- social shaping
- coconstruction
- path dependency
- momentum
- lock-in
- autonomy
- entrapment

``In short, innovation is a vector, rather than just a scalar quantity''  p263

Highlights the normative ideas of technological progress as good p264

``The starting point for this analysis is a distinction between parallel, interlinked, and mutually coconstituting processes of commitment and appraisal in technology governance ... '' p265 

``Appraisal is ... a necessary precondition for intentional commitments, yet only circumstantially so informed in return. This asymmetry between appraisal and commitment raises  questions  for current participatory discourses. In short, what is the purpose of structured exercises in participation? Are they  about informing, or actually forming, the commitments themselves?'' p267

the intention of participation and analysis can be: p268-73
- normative - the right thing to do
- instrumental - aims to secure particular outcomes - e.g. acceptance, trust, social intelligence, 
- substantive - aims at achieving generally better ends - explicit, socially deliberated, publicly reasoned evaluative criteria for the outcomes themselves - e.g. environmental quality

``normative, instrumental, and substantive approaches to  participation that each will tend to display different power dynamics. Normative democratic imperatives aim to ameliorate  the effects of wider power inequalities. Instrumental imperatives tend to support ends conditioned by proximate power structures. Substantive imperatives are ostensibly blind to power, focusing instead on apparently transcendent qualities such as precaution or robustness'' p274-5

All aspects of the process are subject to the influence of power: p275
``... outputs of ostensibly definitive expert analysis are highly susceptible to various kinds of ``framing'' ...  design,  implementation, and interpretation of participatory appraisal also display similar latitude for contingency and agency ... ''

Identifies two forms of justification:
- weak justification - incumbent interests ar insistent that some decision is made and also to deflect blame ``appeals to reified authorities of legitimacy, inclusivity, or representativeness in appraisalmay serve essentially the same function as more technocratic invocations of independent expertise or value-free analysis''
- strong justification - a particular outcome is desired for ``narrow  institutional, parochial, cultural, or partisan political  reasons that are not expedient openly to declare'' and thus framing of the appraisal can secure a desired outcome},

Apparent findings:
1. mini-publics can enable an accurate cross-section of the population to participate on an equal footing
  - designers of mini-publics have made two key moves that grapple seriously with the nuanced dynamics of power:
    1.  invest a huge amount of effort and energy in sophisticated sampling and recruitment methods to ensure a diverse demographic with a representative spread of public opinion
    2. ensure measures are in place which enable participants to speak on an equal footing
2. citizens have the ability to process relevant evidence around complex policy issues
3. citizens can grapple with this complex information as they engage in reasoned debate with each other
4. mini-public deliberation can lead to collective recommendations that capture and convey the (refined) beliefs of participants
5. engaging in mini-public deliberation has a transformative effect on participants and participation

- the awkwardness of the down times on the first day
- expert presentations blend together, inexpert ones stand out
- a participant misses the point but everyone is too polite to correct him
- exhaustion sets in why trying to find consensus
- deflated: the council will just ignore our recommendations
  - political efficacy research into CAs is usually based on feedback immediately after the processes, when things are still warm and fuzzy or individuals don't want to cause trouble

Suggestions:
1. Don't treat everyone equally - some need more support to engage
2. Don't take learning literally - participants are not absorbing everything, not everything needs to be covered, and learning could be less passive
3. Don't prime `nice' discourse -  to be considerate and polite can override the ability to express disagreement with others
4. Don't hand participants control of the agenda - open-endedness in practice places an unfair burden on citizens that leads to confusing claims easily sidelined in political debate
5. Don't pretend mini-publics are apolitical - perhaps be more open about limitations of process at the outset},

This paper presents the rationale for the inclusive valuation of nature's contributions to people (NCP) in decision making, as well as broad methodological steps for doing so. While developed within the context of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), this approach is more widely applicable to initiatives at the knowledge-policy interface, which require a pluralistic approach to recognizing the diversity of values. We argue that transformative practices aiming at sustainable futures would benefit from embracing such diversity, which require recognizing and addressing power relationships across stakeholder groups that hold different values on human nature-relations and NCP.},
  comment          = {Nature's Contribution to People (NCP) bridges notions of nature and a good quality of life

Recognises that there are different worldviews and values associated with NCP and present the rationale for an inclusive incorporation of the diversity of values of NCP in decision making

Emphasis in the consideration of diverse values of NCP to inform policies and everyday practices can be placed, for example on:
- food and feed
- protecting the evolutionary processes of biodiversity and the continued functioning of ecosystems
- honouring the Earth as a sacred living being or on maintaining harmonic relationships between people and nature

Contrast unidimensional value framings (e.g. economic, ecological, social, cultural) with pluralistic valuation (diverse world views). This inform the policy toolbox which is thus restricted in the single world view case.

Acknowledging diverse world views would take a social-ecological perspective, where nature, NCP and a good quality of life are seen as interdependent, and would require activating deliberative approaches towards potential conflict resolution over values. It is associated with the need to leverage power relations through participatory negotiation among stakeholders holding incommensurable values over human-nature relations. p11

Propose a 5-step approach to facilitate valuation:
1. identify the purpose
2. scope the process
3. pluralistic visualisation (methods and assessments)
4. integration and bridging - require transdisciplinarity blending expert valuation and social participatory processes
5. communication on value and review the valuation process

2 key principles:
1. valuation and value assessments require the recognition of a broad range of worldviews
2. valuation requires learning that the incorporation of values and valuation methods into decision making processes are themselves value-laden},

Public Acceptance Model (PAM) is a framework that guides the countries that participate in World Mosquito Program initiative

PAM pillars:
1. implementation of communication and engagement campaigns - objective is to generate knowledge and engagement
of the population regarding the WMP Wolbachia Method
2. creation of a Community Reference Group - objective to create a dialogue relationship with the community through this consultative committee formed by representatives from different sectors in the areas in which it operates
3. implementation of an incident registration system - role of registering and answering the population's doubts and concerns regarding the method
4. conducting community surveys - objective to measure the level of awareness and approval of the method by the community

``it is essential to understand that community engagement goes beyond informing or asking for population consent, but it constitutes a possibility for dialogue and exchange between the various stakeholders present in the territories, to build on cooperation for mosquito-borne disease control''

Points of reflection:
1. territory is alive and needs to be constantly analysed, so that sociocultural particularities are identified and respected in the intervention area
2. plural engagement actions are essential to reach different audiences, however, the basic value of all these actions must be the disposition for dialogue
3. building capacity of the engagement team on the role of dialogue for the mobilisation of communities, with respect to their sociocultural bases, is essential when long-term and large-scale community engagement action is undertaken},

Collective action energy projects are a promising means of supporting this transformation since they redistribute control of energy resources to the citizens and foster sustainable energy behaviours, as well as potentially enhancing energy justice and democracy. The EU has funded a number of collective action energy R&I projects which combine the use of new technologies and community engagement. We identify 28 such projects and investigate the types of community engagement strategies trialed and the challenges they face. We find that engagement strategies comprise a mixture of shorter term participation and longer term behaviour change strategies. There is a tendency towards behaviour change strategies based on feedback and/or rewards, while other promising strategies like targeting group norms are less common. Overall, projects opt for medium-level participation, while co-creative or more empowering approaches are less common. A lack of consistency in approach and a lack of reported data on social impacts of the projects makes it difficult to determine how effective the engagement strategies (and hence projects themselves) have been. We provide some recommendations for designing and monitoring similar research projects going forward.},

``The NCP framework is also careful not to prioritize scientific knowledge on ecological functions and economic values over diverse knowledges, worldviews, and values, as the previous iterations of the ES framework tended to do (Martín-López et al.2014). With the adoption of the concept of NCP, IPBES thus stresses the need of science-policy interfaces to advance the legitimate inclusion of diverse knowledge systems in assessments and planning, to achieve well-being, conservation, and sustainable use'' (PascualEtAl2018) p95

Challenges to the integration of ILK: p96
1. ``tendency of scientists to consider science as superior to ILK (Agrawal1995)'', leads to: 
  - resist making shared decisions with IPLC
  - extract decontextualised knowledge from ILK
2. ``disciplinary backgrounds make it difficult to establish common knowledge about the various social-ecological interplays that make  up and affect biodiversity (Carpenter et al.2009)''
3. ``ES and NCP frameworks tend to emphasize how humans depend on and benefit from nature, that is, NCP (Kenter2018; Peterson et al.2018) and focus less on PCN''

Conceptualisation in `Western' science that there are universal and value-neutral truths and that material and non-material phenomena should be addressed separately  reproduces two dichotomies: p96
- between scientific knowledge and ILK systems
- between social and natural science disciplines

critique of ecosystem services and why NCP emerged p97
but also that NCP gives limited space for the role of people shaping nature, especially the practices that fall beyond different knowledges and worldviews p99

``Post-structuralist, post-humanist, and post-colonial schools of thought ... argue that reality is multiple and that it can be understood by `pluriverses' of knowledge (Escobar2016, p. 13)'' p96

Discourses have 3 elements of meaning (Foucault): p96
- classification systems - categories that reflect items that people values and identify with
- values - qualifications that people use to signify phenomena and guide action
- aspirations - ideal images associated with needs and objectives and people and policies prioritize

This work uses the discourses of planner and indigenous actor groups to identify the resonances and incongruences between their classification systems, values, and aspirations. Data was publications, reports, legal descriptions and interviews with policy-makers and (non) governmental planners involved in an ES policy and processes implementation (SISA) 40 Kaxinaw\'as of varied ages and gender who participated in the local SISA assessment and planning p100

``In the interviews, we probed both planners and Kaxinaw\'as on their aspirations, values, and classification systems and we asked them how they perceived the participatory processes to implement SISA and how they were able to influence the inclusion of knowledge and worldviews'' using circles of dialogue (Freire 2000), participatory mapping (Albuquerque et al. 2014)  p100

[Thus this is participatory analysis of a participatory process]

``analyzed how discourses shaped assessment and planning processes by contrasting how different interview respondents and participants in the workshop reported about the extent to which they were able to influence the participatory processes and its outcomes. This enabled us to identify whether and how knowledge differences present in different discourses influenced power dynamics and affected the inclusion of diverse and relational knowledge and worldviews'' p101

Results are detailed - differences in discourses but observation that SISA discourse moves closer to that on Kaxinaw\'a in terms of non-material and material contributions that people provide to nature respectively via their knowledge, values, aspirations, and their practices. p110

In terms of the participatory processes, soil science planners retained power in deciding when Kaxinaw\'a and social scientists were involved, by judging what was relevant to them -> reduction of the diversity of knowledges and worldviews in the outcomes  p110

and more generally: ``while SISA outcomes were overall considered legitimate by Kaxinaw\'as ... a stronger voice of locals to shape processes could have resulted in a more comprehensive representation of diverse knowledges and worldviews, as well as in an enhanced legitimacy, validity, and relevance of policy outcomes'' p110

In terms of frameworks, find that PCN is still not sufficiently accounted for in NCP and ES

``Our study suggests thus that the legitimacy and effectiveness of environmental assessment and planning can be improved when actors on the science-policy interface facilitate participation  and engagement that gives voice to participants who hold different knowledge systems and disciplines, that focuses on common objectives, aspirations, and priorities which account for both people and ecosystems' roles, and that connects assessment to planning and practice'' p111},

The Phillips Report in the wake of [BSE pandemic of the early 1990s] stressed that it is vital the public be able to see the science on which government statements and policies are based. It stated that:
- To establish credibility it is necessary to generate trust
- Trust can only be generated by openness
- Openness requires recognition of uncertainty, where it exists
- The importance of precautionary measures should not be played down on the grounds that the risk is unproved
- The public should be trusted to respond rationally to openness
- Scientific investigation of risk should be open and transparent
- The advice and the reasoning of advisory committees should be made public
- The trust that the public has in Chief Medical Officers is precious and should not be put at risk},

  abstract         = {This paper presents a framework to understand the impact of scientific knowledge on the policy-making process, focusing on the conceptual impact. We note the continuing dissatisfaction with the quality and effects of science-policy interactions in both theory and practice. We critique the current literature's emphasis on the efforts of scientists to generate policy impact, because it neglects the role of `user' policymaking organisations. The framework offered in the paper develops an argument about the essential role of institutional conditions of policy `users' for scientific knowledge to achieve impact. The framework is informed by the reflexive institutionalist and the neo-institutionalist theoretical approaches. Its main contribution is in outlining the intra- and inter-organisational conditions of policymaking organisations, along with personal characteristics of individual policy officials that influence the likelihood of scientific knowledge to generate conceptual impact. We also offer an operationalisation of the framework. The wider relevance of the paper is in moving the focus from the activities of scientists and the incentive structure in scientific organisations to the policy user side.},
  comment          = {develop a novel conceptual framework to shift the perspective towards the users of science in the policymaking arena - motivated by 4 observation of the impact of science on policymaking:
1. ``there is still dissatisfaction with how and the extent to which science actually informs policy, especially scientific research from academia''
2. ``science, technology and innovation policies are increasingly being formulated to address global challenges and societal missions''
3. ``there is an increasing demand for scientists to produce impactful knowledge ... places the onus of generating impact on scientists''
4. persistence of the idea of linear model of knowledge informing policy and that that better quality evidence has greater impact

Figure 1 describes their framework:
1. scientific knowledge [exists or is created and this is interacts with 
2. conditions [which arise from organisational conditions in the policy setting]:
  2a. intra-organisational [to do with organisational conditions and the personal characteristics of the policy maker]
  2b. inter-organisational (processes, objects and spaces that facilitate knowledge exchange) [both types of condition influence:]
3. impact (instrumental, conceptual, symbolic) [and these influence each other as well as conditions and scientific knowledge] 

``We believe a change of perspective is needed to balance our understanding of how science can generate policy impact. If science's impact on policymaking is considered insufficient, and at the same time, more scientific support is needed to tackle urgent challenges, we suggest a complementary perspective of the science-policy relationship. We develop a novel conceptual framework to shift the perspective towards the users of science in the policymaking arena''

Useful discussion of what is scientific impact on policy and society and how it is currently conceptualised and measured - largely seen as a very limited endeavour and critical that it is scientists to have the responsibility to create and demonstrate impact

Also acknowledges that personal characteristics in policymakers (education, class, etc) and organisational conditions could play significiant role in policy

Discusses how impact can be:
- conceptual - change in cognition
- instrumental - aids decision making - tends to be what is valued and measured
- symbolic - supports pre-existing opinions

``changes in a person's thinking (e.g. conceptual impact) do not always manifest in changes in political action, especially in policymaking, where outcomes are determined by many actors and a wide range of motivations''},

The wicked dimensions of climate change --- the difficulties of problem definition and no stopping rule, in particular --- require rethinking how to best govern efforts toward adaptation and mitigation. Participatory spaces are not neutral: they are created for multiple purposes, providing opportunities for agency and inclusion but also exclusion and hierarchy. Following the logic of wicked problems that requires attention to paradoxes, I identify several paradoxes of participation in climate change governance that need to be considered in the design of public participation. These paradoxes demand attention rather than erasure if we seek better answers to the fundamental questions of who gets to participate in climate change adaptation and how.},
  comment          = {``argue that participation in climate governance is itself a wicked problem. Determining who participates and how is wicked, tricky, and even aggressive''

Critique of Arnstein ladder, identifying other typologies of participation ``Reed identified a plethora of typologies of participation developed by scholars based on:  p64
- the nature of the engagement (the flows of information, for example top-down or bottom-up)
- whether pragmatic or normative
- based upon the objectives of use (for example whether outcome or process oriented)''

dominant rationales are provided for participation: p65
- as a democratic right
- the instrumental use of participation to improve policy

``Done poorly, participation can result in undemocratic outcomes by reinforcing existing power inequalities, marginalizing minority perspectives, creating dysfunction consensus, or fostering cynicism'' p67

In ``Participation: The New Tyranny'' CookeK2001 see 3 tyrannies:
- the tyranny of decision-making and control (outsiders overriding local forms)
- the tyranny of the group (for example elite capture and/or participatory exclusions)
- the tyranny of the method (raising the concern that its dominancy was driving out alternatives)

Wicked dimensions and paradoxes:
- Problem formulation is a crucial stage that requires participation, but problem formulation of adaptation is often seen as a necessary precursor to public engagement - in wicked problems, determining the scope of the problem is a contested issue p71-2

- If communities are allowed to frame the problem, they may not focus on climate change adaptation as the central problem, which could result in inaction on climate change - how will dissent be managed? Maintaining democratic legitimacy requires ample space for and encouragement of agonistic dissent; involving those who disagree about the nature of the problem may keep a group from being able to make decisions together p72-3

- the move toward governance rather than democratic government prompts an additional paradox: Governance opens up a wider variety of actors and strategies that can make decisions about how to address shared problems. Yet governance lacks codified rules and regulations that define norms of participation, which can result in neoliberal and corporate co-optation. Fundamentally this is the postpolitical concern that in the absence of robust theory or norms governance can be co-opted by corporate interests, making governance antidemocratic and environmentalism only a sales pitch p73-4

- who gets to participate: All ``holders'' should be enabled to
participate, but the scale of climate change makes direct participation impractical if not impossible p74-5

- Climate change adaptation has no stopping rule, as it requires on-going governance; in practice, sustaining participation with no stopping point is difficult and can result in politicization of participation over time p75

- participants tend to see problems on a level below their own. But
if a problem is attacked on too low a level, the success of resolution of higher problems may go down due to negative feedback loops caused by addressing lower level problems p75-6},

2. Social perceptions and identities, that is, people value climate policy differently depending on what other people think
3. Perceptions of policy costs and benefits
4. Policy design, such as interactions between different policies
5. Policy communication, that is, what and how to communicate about policies
6. Context, such as political trust, media coverage and geography. 

Policy-makers and civil society at all governmental levels can draw on these insights to build broader and deeper public support to realize a low-carbon transition. While efforts to generate public support, and avoid public opposition, most often need to be tailored to the specific circumstances of each policy and jurisdiction, it is reassuring to know that many systemic leverage points exist to achieve this goal.},

Where ``technologies of hubris'' (p238) are the means with which we like to think we create accountability, e.g. controlling risk by predicting (safety, efficacy, economic efficiency p226) using (risk assessment, cost benefit analysis, climate modelling p238) we need more ``technologies of humility'' that are institutionalised habits of thought that come to grips with the unknown, the uncertain, the ambiguous and the uncontrollable p227. This requires more than formal participation but an ``an intellectual environment in which citizens bring their knowledge and skills to bear on the resolution of common problems'' p227

``The issue, in other words, is no longer whether the public should have a say in technical decisions, but how to promote more meaningful interaction among policy-makers, scientific experts, corporate producers, and the public'' p238

Science is no longer a ``pipeline'' but more dispersed, context-dependent, problem oriented (Mode 2) p226

Describes how Charles Perrow's Normal Accidents was prescient - a series of accidents ``were strung like dark beads through the latter years of the twentieth century and beyond'' - how technology creates its own risks that are not simple probabilities

House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology in Britain issued a report on science and society that began with the ominous observation that relations between the two had
reached a critical phase. The authors foresaw damaging consequences for science and technology if these conditions were allowed to persist. p225

Gives a history of post-war social contract on science ``exchange of government funds and autonomy in return for discoveries, technological innovations, and trained personnel came to be known as America's `social contract for science'.'' p228

Science as also been critiqued along 3 lines: p229-30
- deviating from Mertonian norms (highlighted by fraud, misconduct, profiteering, ...)  p230-1
- no longer just basic and applied but contextual and with a range of objectives (including political), and thus peer review by scientists alone may not be enough (p232-4), e.g. FuntowiczR1993 proposed:  p232
  1. Normal science (can be peer reviewed)
  2. consultancy science  (can be peer reviewed) - application of available knowledge to well-characterized problems
  3. post-normal science (requires extended peer review involving addition of stakeholders and those affect ) - highly-uncertain, highly-contested knowledge needed for many health, safety, and environmental decisions
- knowledge-making is more complex  (applications, institutions, awareness of societal implications) p 234-5

Nowotny et al ``imagine forms of knowledge that would gain robustness from their very embeddedness in society'' p235

Technologies of hubris suffer 3 significant limitations: p238-40
1. don't account for uncertainty and ambiguity - ``predictive methods tend ... to downplay what falls outside their field of vision, and to overstate whatever falls within'' p239 [also Taleb2007 and Kahneman2011]
2. high entry barriers against legitimate positions that cannot express themselves in terms of dominant discourse thus pre-empt the discussion
3. limited capacity to internalise challenges that are outside their framing assumptions

Identify from literature 4 focal points for technologies of humility: p240
- framing p240-1 - and systemmatic approaches to revising framing
- vulnerability p241 - classifications of vulnerability overlook the individual and social foundations of vulnerability, and indeed the potential for agency and resilience (e.g. if able to participate)
- distribution p241-2 - engagement at all stages of the science/technology not just ``end-of-pipe'' ``Sustained interations between decision-makers, experts, and citizens, starting at the upstream end of research and development, could yield significant dividends in exposing the distributive implications of innnovation'' p242
- learning p242 - institutions limited by their own discourse, experience is polysemic, design approaches for societies to collectively reflect on the ambiguity of their experiences},

Harnessing the positive transformation potential for innovation, is about collaboratively exploring complex and uncertain pathways, especially when the goal is sustainable local economic development. Nevertheless, the demand for participatory approaches posed by the re-emergence of mission-orientated innovation policy, and the conditions for their successful implementation at the local level, particularly in the framework of economic development, are poorly understood and not yet in the focus of the current debate. This article conceptualises participation as a new mode of governance for sustainable local economic development, and links it to mission-orientation in innovation policy. We differentiate forms, degree of involvement and target groups, as well as highlight the underlying rationales and modes of interactions. Based on action-research carried out over three years in the city of Bottrop, Germany, we conceptualise an ideal-typical practice of participatory governance. Our findings show that firms are willing to participate in sustainable local economic development, only if they can internalise at least part of the value-added.},

Much of what it draws out is that governance needs to be at more local level

``The best way to do so is `engagement by design', in other words through active participation in shaping the mission, setting priorities and governing the implementation''

``Given the complexity of societal challenges, the contextuality of innovations as a solution to concrete problems including local users [24,25], and the variety of location-specific institutions, it seems rather unlikely that grand challenges will be solved globally (WanzenbockF2020)'' p2

``rather than focusing on mission-oriented innovation policy initiatives, this paper centres on opportunities, challenges and bottlenecks of meaningful governance structures for local economic development. The growing body of literature reflects the high expectations attached to the idea of MIP and its underlying rationale of transformational change but lacks detailing with regard to implementation at the local level''

``MIP is best implemented at the subnational level of regions and cities'' p3

We provide arguments that innovation policies aimed to solve societal challenges, such as climate change or aging, are best pursued at subnational levels given the contested nature of problem identification and the contextual nature of problem-solving. Regional innovation policy, then, should formulate concrete societal goals tailored to the local context, while the transnational context promotes inter-regional learning and provides the complementary policies in the realms of basic research, regulation and taxation. In addition, the supranational level can set overall goals that are made more concrete and operational at the subnational level.},

The article concludes with a brief discussion about potential directions for future research.},

- explain ``why ignoring the public is problematic, especially when it comes to resolving policy confl icts, which almost always are related to public values controversies''
- ``theorize about how various participation design choices may (or may not) maximize the likelihood of administrators eliciting and responding to public values in policy conflicts''

``Moore (1995) asserts that public value creation occurs when managers focus attention on three key questions about purpose: p699
- whether the  purpose is publicly valuable
- whether it will be  politically and legally supported
- whether it is administratively and operationally feasible''

which contrasts with the ``complex, relatively stable emotio-cognitive assessments that guide individual behavior'' p699

in public administration ``nearly all controversies boil down to choices among competing values'' p670

``the question becomes how to design public participation processes to maximize the likelihood of  identifying and understanding public values with regard to a particular policy issue or decision'' p701

8 participatory design elements (for helping public administrators identify and understand public values), each with a proposition: p701
1. level of cooperation -  interests focus on identifying the concerns, needs, and values held by individuals and groups, propositions are set up to support conflicting positions - interests are the reasons underlying a position - people tend to have only one position but many reasons - proposition that interest-based are more than position-based to generate cooperation p701
2. communication mode - public participation processes can employ one-way, two-way, and/or deliberative communication modes - develop along the IAP2 Spectrum (IAP22018) - proposition that deliberative communcation is more likely than two-way to assist value identification, and one-way is least likely p701-2
3. level of shared decision authority - along the IAP2 spectrum - proposition that processes with moderate to high levels of shared  decision authority more likely to identify and understand public values p702-3
4. participatory mechanisms - proposition that small table format with integration processes are better and that professional facilitators are better p703-4
5. informational materials - proposition that providing informational material are better p704
6. participant  selection - proposition that public selection is better than stakeholder selection p704
7. participant recruitment - proposition that recruitment strategies that seek to reduce bias rather than self-selection are better p704-5
8. recurrence and iteration - proposition that multiple participatory events are better when policy issue is complex p705

i.e. participatory processes are more likely to help administrators identify and understand all of the relevant public values and values sets when they are designed to: p705
- Be interest-based
- Use deliberative communication modes
- Have moderate to high levels of shared decision authority
- Use small table formats with trained facilitators
- Provide informational materials
- Select participants from members of the public
- Use recruitment strategies that minimize participation bias

Our contribution is threefold: first, we apply transformer-based language models (i.e., BERT and RoBERTa) to the classification of generic frames showing that these models improve the results presented in the literature for frame identification; second, we investigate the task of topic modelling in political arguments from the U.S. presidential campaign debates, applying an unsupervised machine learning approach; and finally, we discuss various visualisations of the identified topics and frames from these U.S. presidential election debates to allow a further interpretation of such data.},
  comment          = {``Topics and frames cover two different viewpoints on the arguments put forward in the debate ... topics are identified by the keywords that make them distinct from the other topics ... framing is how an argument by a debater is put forward through selected words to react to the discussion about the topics in debate''

Entman [10] defines framing as follows: ``To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, casual interpretation, moral evaluation and/or treatment recommendation.''

```automatic identification of topics and frames ... to enrich argument-based information''

This paper:
1. apply transformer-based language models (i.e., BERT and RoBERTA) to classify generic frames
2. apply an unsupervised machine learning approach for topic modeling which takes advantage of sentence embeddings to represent the debates
3. provide some visualisations of the identified topics and frames

AjjourAWS2019 ``define frames to be non-overlapping aspects of arguments on the same subject while concealing other aspects ... first cluster the documents into topics using TF-IDF features of the debate and argument components with k-means, then they remove the topic from these clusters by using the prominent terms for each topic extracted by C-TF-IDF and again cluster the results into frames''

``Topic modeling [26] has been used for a long time along with bag of words features and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or other matrix factorisation models. Recently, with the advancement of Language Models, topic modeling has also been adapted to the use of transformer-based models such as BERT [8]''

  abstract         = {Automatic content analysis is more and more becoming an accepted research method in social science. In political science researchers are using party manifestos and transcripts of political speeches to analyze the positions of different actors. Existing approaches are limited to a single dimension, in particular, they cannot distinguish between the positions with respect to a specific topic. In this paper, we propose a method for analyzing and comparing documents according to a set of predefined topics that is based on an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for inducing knowledge about relevant topics. We validate the method by showing that it can guess which member of a coalition was assigned a certain ministry based on a comparison of the parties' election manifestos with the coalition contract. We apply the method to German National Elections since 1990 and show that the use of our method consistently outperforms a baseline method that simulates manual annotation of individual sentences based on keywords and standard text comparison. In our experiments, we compare two different extensions of LDA and investigate the influence of the used seed set. Finally, we give a brief illustration of how the output of our method can be interpreted to compare positions towards specific topics across several parties.},
  comment          = {argue that there is a need for new analysis methods that are able to discriminate between positions on different policy areas and treat them independently

Analyse manefestos (of German political parties) as these are ``independent of personal opinions and opportunistic statements that influence for instance political speeches''

``to compare two documents containing several topics, we first extract the topics automatically by running a topic model on each of the documents. Then, the positions towards the topics can be analyzed by measuring the distance between the corresponding topics''

Use textiling for splitting documents automatically into topically coherent chunks

``the underlying assumption of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, [is] that a single document always addresses a number of different topics to a certain extent which is given by the Dirichlet distribution'' p40

Tag parts of speech and experiments find that nouns are best for topic modelling, with adjectives identifying how words are percieved by the respective party [framing?]. The exclude very infrequent and stop words

versions of LDA:
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by Blei et al. [9]
- Labeled LDA by Ramage et al. [11] extends LDA by allowing for learning from multiply labeled documents
- LogicLDA [12] by Andrzejewski et al. is an extension of LDA that offers the possibility to include first order knowledge

Use seed words to identify topics - ``if a snippet contains a seed word for a topic, we add its topic as a label''

``The result of the topic creation is a set of multinomials over word tokens that represent the different topics in a document. According to our assumptions, these multinomials represent the position of the authors of a document with respect to the respective topic''

Test their approach by applying to coalition contracts. These are written by multiple parties but are expected to be mostly influenced by the party in control and thus this should be the result of the party position inference. It seems to have worked quite well.},

Our study explores multi-level networks of superposed and partially connected interdependencies, the first being inter-organizational, the second inter-individual. We propose a method of structural linked design as an articulation for these levels. First, we examine separately the complete networks at each level. Second, we combine the two networks in relation to one another using systematic information about the membership of each individual in the first network (inter-individual) to one of the organizations in the second network (inter-organizational), as in bipartite networks. This dual positioning, or the linked design approach, is carried out in an empirical study examining performance variations within the “elite” of French cancer researchers in 1999. By looking at measures of centrality, we identify the actors that these top researchers consider as central or peripheral at the inter-individual level (the big and the little fish among the elite), and the laboratories that the research directors consider as central or peripheral at the inter-organizational level (the big and the little ponds among all the laboratories conducting cancer research in France at that time). In addition to the rather trivial report of the competitive advantage of big fish in big ponds (particularly because of the advantage of size for laboratories in this field), we use measurements of scientific performance to identify “catching up” strategies that the smallest fish use in this system. We suggest that this method offers new insights into the duality and multi-level dimension of complex systems of interdependencies, and also into the ways in which actors manage these interdependencies. We believe that it adds a new dimension to the sociological exploration of the determinants of performance, of meso-level phenomena such as opportunity structures and institutional change, or of macro-level phenomena such as social inequalities.},

- debate - a means for the involved parties to resolve their disagreement - characterized by a

- arguments - e.g. a pro argument could be “Abortion is good for a free society because it gives women their basic right of controlling their bodies.” while a con argument could be “Abortion is against human rights because it is a systematic murder of innocent life.” - arguments consist of
- conclusion - (the bit after because), and one or more 
- premises

Their approach:
1. topic clustering - cluster with k-means over spaces defined by TF-IDF and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) with arguments as documents and LSA with debates as documents (this latter approach had better results - it provides more context p2928)
2. topic removal - two approaches:
  a. utilises the content of the arguments in a cluster by using tf-idf to select the words that best discriminate the topic
  b. utlises the structure of the argument by removing the conclusion - this worked better
3. frame clustering - use k-means again on data with topic information removed - this worked better than not removing the topics},

Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, Leviathan and the Air Pump, looks at how science is undertaken and identify how there is a strong social aspect

The line of work led to science studies and also to looking at scientific controversies (as they would have been in their day) to consider how they were resolved 

Boyle designed the air-pump to experiment with how air is necessary to life. Before that there was natural philosophy - what people observed - and arts (what we'd call engineering) - Boyle's work brough both together. He also invited in witnesses and wrote up the experiments in a manner that made the reader much like a witness. Hobbes disagreed with this approach and didn't believe that just seeing the experiment was enough to compel people to agree. This fight was largely hidden from history.

From the 80s-90s - ``science wars'' - Schaffer and others accused of constructivism by challenging the ideas of how science occurred. They identified that scientists should be neither deified [my word] or considered completely ordinary.

The phrase ``public understanding of science'' is intrinsically ambiguous

- elements of a governance framework are identified
- steps towards ethical compliance and policy formation are proposed

Use as models for governance discussions around biomedicine (e.g. embryonic stem cells), conventional/classical robotics and artificial intelligence

Questions arise around:
- integrity of life
- status and rights of semi-living beings
- potential long-term impacts on natural ecosystems
- unknown unknowns

Four different schools of relevant ethics:
- consequentialism - consequence - produces the best available consequences (e.g. on balance, utilitarian)
- deontologism - universal rule - actions should be guided by universal applicaton of moral principles
- virtue ethics - prudence (phronesis) - a virtuous person would take such action
- ethics of responsibility - responsibility - aka environmental ethics

Categorise the ethical issues of bio-hybrid robots into:
- interactivity
- integrability (assimilation)
- ontological and moral status (e.g. as a living thing or if consciousness is developed)

Describe 3 scenarios arising from bio-hybrid technologies and outline their benefits, disbenefits and questions to be asked about these. From this, a series of ``critical questions'' around each of the ethics schools of thought by which 6 necessities of the framework are identified (which are like instructions for anyone engaged in work around bio-hybrid robotics).

The section on policy strategies:
- regulation necessary but may be controversial - call for stakeholder participation in in this

In the 1970s as the ``strong programme'' - researchers should adopt symmetry by not assuming one or other side is right (Bloor)

Constructivists instead considered that facts can only be determined after a controversy has ended (Latour) but this became criticised for epistemic relativism [anything goes]

Another position is why society doesn't accept prevailing expert consensus - answers include powerful interests tainting science, producing ignrance (agnotology)

And why settled beliefs become controvesial again - answers include new technologies changing the way we percieve the world - which leads to new disciplines

Climate science and genomics [and AI] arose out of new technologies changing the way we see the world

And why different settings have different settled v controversy perspectives (and expert v normative dimensions) on the same topics (law and politics can have very distinct framings)

MSA is ``antidote to the biggest work of fiction in policy studies: rational policymaking during a policy cycle''

Policymaking is only a little rational - there are irrational aspects that enable the selection from too much information on both problems and solutions. Policy entrepreneurs are both problem- and knowledge-brokers

Entrepreneurs have 3 strategies to maximise their impact:
1. tell a good story about the policy problem - combining evidence and emotional appeals - agenda setting is about exercising power to generate attention (framing reduces ambiguity) and producing high-quality evidence (reducing uncertainty) - example of tobacco control
2. have a solution ready to chase a problem - ideas are chameleon-like, adapting to new environment - timing matters
3. `surf the waves' or try to move the sea - venue shop and venue shift, pre-soften solutions, emulate Poseiden, identify when MSA does not apply - how to adapt their environment to exploit or create windows of opportunity},

Cognitive dissonance theory predicted, and evidence from experimentation demonstrated, that attitudes are derived from action (not the presumed other way around). p3-4

Agency, `knowing how to act in order to bring about an intended effect', is also important and social learning is key to this

Self-persuasion can be negative or positive. When positive, action inspires action and agency and efficacy are deepened p4

More domains of agency need to be developed through communities of practice. Currently climate agency is only observed in: p5
- acting on one's personal carbon footprint
- climate activism

Education-entertainment and positive deviance, used within health domains, offer ways of generated these effects (agency, attitude from behaviour, self-persuasion). To this end a story structure is outlined that has agency at its heart. The team are working with screenwriters on these approaches.

Great for literature on these different aspects as well as the overall framework

Attributes (can be nurtured):
- ambition
- social acuity
- credibility
- sociability
- tenacity

Skills (can be learned):
- strategic thinking
- team building
- collecting evidence
- making arguments
- engagement multiple audiences
- negotiating
- networking

Strategies (depend on attributes and skills):
- problem framing
- using and expanding networks
- working with advocacy coalitions
- leading by example
- scaling up changes processes

``while the literature on policy entrepreneurship often places the focus on specific individuals, how they collaborate with others is always fundamental to explaining the development and promotion of policy innovations (see Huitema, Lebel, and Meijerink  2011); Mintrom and Thomas  2018). Some contributors to this literature have suggested that organizations, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, can serve as policy entrepreneurs''

``Framing problems in new ways can improve chances of building winning coalitions''

Framing tactics:
- presenting evidence to suggest a crisis is at hand
- highlighting failures of current policy settings
- drawing support of actors beyond immediate problem scope

Meaning is constructed through discussion with others in order to establish persuasive frames

Potentially very useful case study: Ken Livingstone framed climate change as an urban issue and ``showed other city leaders how to assert themselves as central players on climate change policy'' leading to the C40 network of cities [modelling action as in De Meyer] he also built links across cities [collaboration across silos?]},

Highly quantitative study finding that anti-HVHF with higher centrality (more links into network) were more influential (for pro-HVHF, the degree centrality did not seem to have an effect). Pro-HVHF are advantaged by having higher power connections such as ``insider'' political actors. Cohesion (degree of connected across the network - the ratio of actual to possible triads) affects the anti-HVHF position, with less cohesion leading to more success. For both groups (some caution advised with anti-HVHF) having connections to larger coalitions who are sympathetic to their cause is influential.

Also helped by political conditions - party leaders vying to have environmental credentials

``as the window of opportunity for change opened in the problem and politics streams, FoE made a radical *policy* solution, the Climate Change Bill, available to policymakers (see also Lorenzoni and Benson)''

``The Big Ask was not particularly innovative'' but the less successful previous legislation ideas provided lessons [pre-softened]

``Worthington made the case for a top-down approach, setting overall targets and then working out policies to reach the targets'' [this and other examples of action rather than issue communications]

``In February 2005, FoE met other ENGOs to seek support for the idea and the campaign. WWF and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds took a 'wait and see' position; Greenpeace rejected the idea (although later it supported it). So FoE decided to proceed alone''},

In the practical implications they outline the means by which bureaucratic structures of organisations may be enablers of moral disengagement

Bandura (1986) suggested that moral self-regulation can be deactivated or disengaged via 8 mechanisms:
- moral justification
- euphemistic labeling
- advantageous comparison
- displacement of responsibility
- diffusion of responsibility
- disregarding or distorting the consequences
- dehumanization
- attribution of blame

Hypothesise that moral disengagement is related to:
- empathy (negatively) - disposition view of empathy, some individuals are more vicarious empathetic
- trait cynicism (positively) - a philosophy of human nature developed through early experience related to frustration with and distrust of others
- locus of control orientations (positively related to chance external local of control and power external local of control, negatively related to internal local of control) - where individuals percieve control on outcomes lies (luck, powerful others, their own behaviour, etc)

Interview participants in the process of creating policy around a coastal protection/enhancement scheme in the Netherlands. The actors begin either happy with the current scheme (don't see any problem) or are keen to implement an innovative solution (they have a solution in mind).

IPA is abductive and links interpretative policy analysis [IPA] with the MSF [MSA] (they cite two other papers that have attempted this).

Discuss they framing interaction mechanisms are used. IPE characteristics (based on other works):
- sense-making
- defining problems in others' terms
- building epistemic communities
- willing to take risks (not strictly interpretative)

This interactional framing involves actor making meaning together (rather than alone or for but not with others). ``Frame-convergent framing moves bring about reframing among other actors, thereby increasing the epistemic community''. Other framings have negative outcomes. Framing interactions (from Dewulf and Bouwen 2012):
- incorporation - include watered-down version of other frame
- accommodation - include near-exact copy of other frame
- reconnection - overcoming conflict
- disconnection - worsening conflict
- polarisation 

``convinced other actors that issues on different levels and in different sectors could be solved by using the same policy solution''

Actors had different interpretations of the problem ``the Sand Motor case represents a `frame conflict' between actors, such as the provincial government, who expect the Sand Motor to be a promising technology and actors, such as the public works agency, who feel there is no need for experimentation when lives are at stake and the technology in place works''

From interviews, constructed timelines and identified when participants perceived change in theirs or others' framings, when interactions occurred. From these determined what type of framing interactions occurred. From this they identify an individual IPE. Note a ``gradual opening up of most actors'' [Cairney's softening?]

Interesting to note that one party did not engage at the start because they did not perceive a problem - this needed other actors to reframe to solve the frame conflict. Also that polarisation was used by one group to gain power by building support - this led to a top-down order for the the other group to comply.},

Bring together concepts of boundary organisation (BO) with policy entrepreneur (PE) and problem broker (PB) from and multiple streams analysis (MSA)

Argue that KBOs can act as BOs, PEs and PBs

My summary of their findings is that bringing the PE and PB aspects into the model permits better understanding of the more political and/or subjective aspects of the KBO (e.g. see tensions below) but it does not explain how tensions are reconciled.

Note a conflict [my word] in KBO's roles between providing `objective' [their quotes] evidence and determining what counts as evidence
Tensions: 
- objectivity versus finding common ground, making recommendations, influencing and steering
- evidence versus ideas - depends on the KBO
- credible versus selective evidence
- in the politics - tend not to address question sof interests, agendas and alliances in the policy process and yet are pulled into this is various ways (by proximity to, dependance on, government)

Credibility is built in different ways:
- BOs - established by balancing the needs and values of both worlds
- PEs, and to some extent PBs, assist decision-makers by helping them privilege particular ('credible') framings of policy problems and solutions

KBOs are highly diverse but have 3 characteristics:
1. evidence and evidence-informed policymaking is central to their work
2. tend to use the tools and practices of knowledge-brokering
3. close links to government due to funding

BOs:
- involve participation of players from different worlds e.g. research and policy
- produce boundary objects e.g. evidence reviews
- principle-agent relationships with each side of boundary e.g. can be principle of commissioned research and agent contracted by governement

literature on BOs is often more on their aims than their actions

``KBOs ... position themselves as neither official nor interest based and therefore trustworthy''

``multiple coexisting boundaries between research, policy, and practice that KBOs bridge: epistemic, professional, and organisational''

Interviews are with 85 politicians from France, Denmark, Germany, UK and US, a range of polticial parties, some who've never been in government. Diverse perspectives are identified, largely along political lines. Also ``triangulated'' with politicians' advisors. Particularly interesting for the method - detailed in the appendix

Did not intruduce environment/climate into interview until late (if at all - it was not introduced for early interviews) to give a sense of how much these topics were considered to relate to the overt topic of economics.

Chapter 1 Do we need more economic experts?

Situates the book in the timing of COP26, noticing how many financial advisors to governments attended - awareness that climate has a strong financial/economic aspect. Introduces the suggestion by some for a new technocracy - previously right wing politicians have called for some aspects of the state to be ``depoliticised'' and passed on to relevant experts, privatised utilities - now there's a progressive call to use experts to advise on the climate and other crises. This could suit politicians who can blame others if it doesn't pan out.

Chapter 2 Politicians' respect for economists

Broad patterns within the interviews. Far-right parties resisted being interviewed. Economic goals are often expressed in a moralistic way - distributive justice and growth, so that people have the things they want. Analysed which economists were mentioned (elicited by indirect questions such as how useful they found exonomists) and found a quarter barely mentioned any. Questioned about economists objectivity - those with centre-right thinking about neoclassical mainstream economists were more likely that others to say they think they are objective and accepted economists as scientists to a degree. But more were sceptical about economists' objectivity. Many do not seem to respect the specialised knowledge of economists - finding them too technical or their advice impractical. Also politicians believe if is their own responsibliity to make decisions, some with advice from economists and other experts. Those economists/schools most respected are Keynes and Liberals, followed by Marx/Hayek/Free Market, then Adam Smith/Friedman/Council of economic advisors. Give a top-20 21st century economists positively cited (includes Behaviourl economists, Piketty, Rawaroth, Krugman, Mazzucato).

Chapter 8 Politicians and climate change economists

Given the results and what the interviewees said, what place economics expertise in tackling the climate emergency? Having not directly questioned about this, at least at the start, an indication about how much climate mattered could be gauged. Divergent ideas falling into 3 categories:
1. threat from climate change as only marginally affecting their economic ideas, either because they think the threat is not severe or because they think they can deal with it within their existing market-based economic paradigms, adaptation such as insurance is more valued than mitigation which may cause the economy to ``suffer''
2. modified their responses to a greater extent - a very large group that spans different approaches
3. environmentalism should become the basis for economic thinking - believing in ``socio-ecological restructuring''

far-left politicians who argue for radical environmentalist and social economic policies are divided into Marxist ``productivist'' (often embraced by trade unionists) and a more ``post-work'' orientation and opt for ``de-growth''

Sense the politicians have changed their perspectives a great deal, but environment is still ``tacked onto how they always thought about the economy'' this may not be so for future generations of politicians. p118

Discussion of how voters may not understand economic ideas, how heterodox left ideas are far from economic visions of self-interest voters,

Other chpateres go into more details on individual countries and politicians relationship to voters, including chapters on educating voters},

  comment          = {Fascinating discussion of works of fiction and fact that are aimed at generating emotional responses to science, particular climate change

In particular this considers:
- Michael Crichton's 2004 State of Fear, a fictional commentary of mis-use of science ``facts'', in this case to make people belief climate change is worse than it really is
- Naomi Oresks and Eric M. Conway's 2010 Merchants of Doubt, a non-fictional account of how science has been misused to undermine scientific consensus

The lens is STS, in particular the fall-out from the ``science wars'' of the 1990s [descirbed in Jasanoff2019] and arguments around objectivity, particularly the argument for summetry, all of which emerged out of works of Kuhn and of Fleck who discussed fact-making as a social enterprise. Arguments that expertise, credibility, situatedness and power are all part of this discussion [also CayleyS2009]

State of Fear came after 2004's The Day After Tomorrow which was a not-terribly accurate fictional portrayal of the consequences of climate change that had been shown to increase levels of public concern about global warming

In 2014, Oreske and Conway created a fictional response, The Collapse of Western Civilisation: A View From the Future, intended to be more science-based

Criticism of scientists for using fear to generate a response - emotions are not objective
Others hail these works as bold efforts for getting to grips with fact
Interestingly the opposite responses to the accounts are given by the same parties (e.g. positive about Oreske and Conway, negative about Crichton)

Latour had argued that STS and allied academics need to ``shift from a precoccupation with mere matters of fact to matters of concern'' - Crichton rejected this - Latour was concerned that the ``tools of deconstruction ... had begun to be weaponized'' [i.e. used to undermine scientific concensus, leading to science wars]},

Emotion plays a role in shaping how a concept is represented, particularly more abstract concepts, and this can be tied to your identity

Climate scientists and economists have very different conceptualisations of ``risk'' and ``uncertainty'', due to different practices

economist - uncertainty is like doubt, risk is calculable

climate scientist - risk is a negative consequence

``Physical scientists are usually most concerned with avoiding false positives results from their work .. erring on the side of least drama''

``developed a scale called the self-censorship orientation (SCO) with the assumption that those who support the use of self-censorship are also more likely to practice it''

clarify the general value of a free flow of information:
- freedom of expression
- full and free access to information - public interest and societal welbeing
- the right to be informed
- unrestrained flow of information may also be harmful
- some social/cultural contexts encourage self-censorship

provide a definition of self-censorship and discusses its nature:
- ``intentionally and voluntarily withholding information from others in the absence of formal obstacles''
- sociopsychological mechanism, along with conformity and obedience
- in some contexts its akin to conformity, if one perceives that one's opinion is not shared and so does not express it
- consider the definition to include that this is new information for the context
- but limit it to information, not opinion (i.e. thoughts, ideas, beliefs, or value judgments)

SC may occur due to:
1. negative implications for the individual
2. negative implications for other specific individuals
3. negative implications for the ingroup
4. negative implications for a valued belief
5. implications for a third party

Self-censor may be
- gatekeeper v ordinary person
- people possessing first-hand v second-hand information
- witholding unequivocal truthful information v information of questionable validity

describe the psychological bases of self-censorship:
- given ``the need to share'', it is assumed that self-censorship has a serious motive
- identifying with a group can lead to witholding information that may harm the group
- revealing information may violate some principle, even if the information is socially relevant

introduce the underlying motivational basis of self-censorship and differentiates self-censorship from two sociopsychological concepts: conformity and obedience. Motivations to:
- protect the ingroup
- avoid external negative sanctions and gain positive rewards (personal) (to avoid damaged reputation, delegitimization, and being ostracized, or concrete punishment such as dismissal, imprisonment, and even physical violence; to gain social approval, awards or concrete rewards, and even self-satisfaction)
- protect self-image
- protect a belief
- protect a third party

Go into detail about research into self-censorship regarding Isreali-Palestinian conflict

antecedents and consequences of self-censorhsip:
- armed confrontation significantly increases support for self-censorship in comparison to times of relative calm
- personal characteristics (e.g., authoritarianism, ethnocentrism, siege mentality) predicted support for self-censorship
- double standards - support SC within their own context but not in other societies},

make a distinction between four forms of hidden suppression:
- political and economic control e.g. research funders sanitising results 
- organizational control e.g. needing to seek permission for interviews and op-eds
- control between rival academics e.g. derogation of younger researchers
- control from the publics e.g. researchers not talking publicly about their work due to fear of harrassment 

There are varying amounts of work into:
- political and economic control
- mutual silencing or suppression between researchers
- aggressive feedback from ordinary citizens and the lay public that is intended to intimidate scientists

In Finland, ``academic capitalism and the commodification of academic research (e.g., Hackett 1990) have shaped academic organizations and academic work so that ``(s)cientists' alienation, dissatisfaction with research, and eroding conditions of employment'' (Hackett 2014, 635) have become major concerns''

Interesting for methodology of identify [best practice] solutions and seeing if decision-makers use these and, if not, why not. From this understand what mechanisms limit the way decision-makers use expertise

Identified theoretical explanations for actions of planners and then searched for evidence statements for these (in documents and interviews) and used these to critically discuss if the explanation was relevant in the concrete case

For each case study, drew out the elements in the plan and used literature to determine if it would have affect of reducing or increasing traffic volumes

Looked at the mechanisms through which expert knowledge may introduced were important to each case study, and how they contribute to achieving the goal

Also identified counter-productive mechanisms (e.g. not introducing a traffic reduction objective)

Find that planners use expert knowledge to argue for co-ordinating land-use and transport planning, and for certain strategies, but still use measure that reduce their potential to achieve their goal. Propose 4 explanations for this:
1. The ways planners gain knowledge affects how they use or ignore expert knowledge when making plans [informal and non-compulsory ways of learning about state-of-the-art]
2. The ways planners use or ignore expert knowledge when making plans -- their practice -- cause that counter-productive measures are included in plans - this is a lot about framing an culture
3. Characteristics of the expert knowledge cause planners either not to use it or to use it wrongly - knowledge is not available in precise and unquestionable answers, ``asymmetric buden of evidence'', difficult to identify the most authoratative source
4. The distribution and exertion of power in planning processes prevents planners from using the expert knowledge when making plans - Lukes2005 and BachrachBaratz1962

Recommend that planning professionals (as a body):
1. make their main objective high on the agenda
2. find ways of solving challenge and meeting conflicting objectives
3. use documented and research-based knowledge when this becomes difficult
4. be more critical of own ideas
5. present clear descriptions of cause-effect relations
6. know and exercise their power as knowledge carriers

Recommend that planning researchers:
- produce evidence that strengthens the expert knowledge of planners
- contribute with relevant articles in popular science journals, and in seminars, conferences and courses directed towards practitioners, and to planning debates
- produce summaries relevant to planning practice
- seek out knowledge about what is relevant to planning practice


Planners act based on their:
- objectives
- expert knowledge
- powers

which affects the objectives that are made prominent and the knowledge that is applied - which affects whether plans achieve objectives

There's ``relatively widespread agreement in the scientific literature on how land-use and transport systems ought to be developed if urban road traffic volumes are to be reduced ... summarised and simplified as... :
- Developing land-use as urban densification close to city centres, as `car-independent' location of new activities, and with daily services within walking distance of residential areas (density, centrality, accessibility)
- Improving public transport services (frequency, coverage, speed, comfort, prices) and conditions for walking and cycling (infrastructure, maintenance, land-use)
- Imposing physical and fiscal restrictions on road traffic (road tolls, road capacity reductions, reduced access to parking or increased parking prices)''

Great for references of studies considering what influences e.g. car use (such as increased road capacity increases car use), urban structure

``A main impression from readings published over recent decades, however, is that planning theory *does not* deal much with expert knowledge on concrete issues planning deals with, the role of such knowledge in planning processes and how it affects the content of plans''

This is being limited due to the zero harassments policy and the requirement that people be collegial.

We have entered into a dangerous place of self-censorship and decisions being made using incomplete information.''

from the data file: ``There is an embedded pattern of top down control and self censorship that is independent of the administration. There is a list of 30+ controversial topics and research on these topics must be reviewed by National Program staff before publication. I believe that this list goes further back than the Obama administration.''

Decision-makers not receiving this knowledge on lack of evidence because funding calls do not permit that knowledge to surface - actively suppress it.

``It is a source of immense frustration to us that senior and influential members of the climate community have frequently expressed off-the-record views about the implications of current `best science' that they will not say in public''

In IPCC's 5th assessment report, ``net zero'' is mentioned 23 times, mainly in relation to proven technologies such as Passivhaus buildings. In the 6th assessment report, ``net zero'' is mentioned 963 times, overwhelmingly in the context of speculative negative emissions and carbon capture technologies.

There is a ``mitigation-deterrent'' effect of allowing these technologies to do the heavy-lifting

``At the tricky interface between science and policy, the freedom to `speak truth to power' is essential for an honest representation of the science to be delivered. Sadly, such freedom is not offered on a plate by inherently conservative (with a small `c') governments and civil service departments. Funded calls for research typically exclude inquiry into policy responses unlikely to align with the incumbent economic paradigm. Moreover, research outcomes that don't support the paradigm seldom, if ever, achieve policy impact ... within these narrow ideological constraints that supposedly impartial academic researchers are expected to forge their careers by securing grant funding. Good luck getting funding for research that questions the groupthink, or even for work that isn't obviously corroborative of it''

IPCC has internalised the logic of future discounting and deployment of ``carbon unicorns'' p36

Baseline scenario is continuing with existing trends - leaving out impacts of climate for instance p40 - and an imperative of gradualism p42

IPCC models based on orthodox economics and assume fully functioning markets and competitive market behaviour - thus largely ignore transformation by mass behavioural change or government non-market interventions (because these are less cost-efficient) p36-7

Thus, negative emissions technologies fit the ``commitment to the ideology of mainstream economics, a narrow reliance on cost-effectiveness as the most appropriate way to mediate between alternative climate futures''

It may be that it is possible to massively reduce emissions without negative emissions technologies, probably at much greater cost financially p44 but also maybe politically (although what politically realistic mitigation options are there?) p45

Issues around the creation of knowledge becoming political - modellers are just creating scenarios but these become prescriptive - the dominant discourse creates constraints on science: p38
- problems are articulated in a way that is compatible with prevailing political and economic logics
- solutions proposed within these logics
- thus knowledge production reflects existing power relations

``value-laden and contestable assumptions appear as somehow unavoidable or ``natural,''which closes opportunities for debate and the involvement of dissenting voices''

Faster progress with the same level of political will and social will and resources

The science:

Is essential - we need this to know about climate change

However research that is done and communicated is in the form of forecasting - Sharpe argues for more risk assessment

forecasting is - what will happen and do we care?
risk assessment is - what is the worst that could happen to what we care about and then how likely is that? e.g. what are our limits to tolerance

Science culture of risk is very averse to false positives unlike insurance or defence who are very averse to false negatives

Suggest risk assessment exercises in each country brining together risk experts and climate scientists. 

The economics:

There are irreducable uncertainties and inherent subjectivity (e.g. about what we care about) and so economists cannot reasonably put numbers on the economics of the problem
They can put numbers on the economics of the solution

Economics assumes equilibrium which is fundamentally flawed, particularly in a rapidly changing world - constant change, uncertainty, complex dynamics

If you think of system in equilibrium, you tax existing systems. If you assume it is dynamic, you invest in new approaches. Analogy is move from horse to car - we didn't do it by putting a tax on horse manure

The diplomacy:

diplomacy has a number of approaches that could be used:
- scale - don't negotiate everything all at once, break down the sectors and negotiate these separately
- participation - don't try to get everyone in the room, bring in enough to influence the rest
- timing - don't create targets well into the future when governments are very uncertain [and largely don't care] but work on near term objectives and changes may be greater than anticipated},

Today, more environmental scientists are actively sharing their science broadly, conducting use-inspired science (sensu Stokes) in addition to basic science, engaging with society, and crafting solutions to problems not just diagnosing them—all very welcome and exciting developments. For the most part, however, environmental scientists have taken on these extra duties because they believed it was the right thing to do and despite the considerable impediments that exist within academia. But make no mistake, the culture of academia continues to impede progress. As a result, although the above actions have had demonstrable effect, their collective impact falls far short of what is needed if society is to tackle effectively the disruption underway due to climate change, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, pandemics, and more. Actions by individuals can take us only so far. To truly help society meet its grand challenges, environmental scientists must now make a quantum leap in engagement with society. It is time for strategic, collective action to change the culture of academia and create the enabling conditions for science to serve society better.},

Moment of truth, all hands on deck, social contract, etc

In that article Lubchenco identifies that too much vital science knowledge, e.g. on environmental problems, is hidden in publications and not enough is exposed to the public or policy as knowledge and for scrutiny - science is not delivering on its social contract

``Many scientists do not appreciate that numerous factors beyond scientific information influence the decisions made by both institutions and individuals''

``science is not at the table because it is not accessible, understandable, or seen as relevant, or credible''

Story about VP Biden being surprised that he understood the science as she explained it

A lot has changed in the 22 years
- much more science communication, e.g. social media
- more use-inspired science (tackling big, wicked problems and producing knowledge that can be immediatly helpful)
- engaging with society beyond simply communicating 
- co-creating solutions beyond simply diagnosing problems

But this has been insufficient because they have been individual efforts - academic culture does not value or reward scientists who do these things. Collective action is needed, which entails:
1. dialogue about engagement as a core responsibility
2. incentivising these engagements
3. training, mentoring, etc on engagement, conflict resolution, negotiation, systems thinking, teamwork
4. building partnerships e.g. between university and local community
5. create communities of practice about engagement and scalable solutions
6. funding is requred for these changes to be effective

Q\&A hosted by Rapley follows asking about:
- barriers to large institutions making such changes
- reductionism v holistic approach
- engaging young scientists
- incentives},

Three arguments:
1. social knowledge (which is evolutionary) needs the interaction between study and making of policy - neither can make a superior claim on it
2. both the why (scholars) and the how (policy) of social knowledge are necessary
3. both have political commitments to pursue their task which are different and complementary

Different understandings of truth:
- Objective - mainly the domain of academic world since policy world manipulates truth for political ends - but objective understanding is ambitious, self-serving and demeans policy-making
- Subjective (relative) - or intersubjective in that it is (socially) constructed by epistemic community, contingent and relative (critical or historic school, Kuhn), social context even for physical sciences, constructivist especially social science
- Evolutionary - embedded in history and unfolds as history progresses (Marx), very much in the social realm as patterns are created by individuals and society and observed as such

Continues as if the last - evolutionary - is the case - and thus both scholarship and policy-making share the quest for truth

Of scholars and policy-makers, both believe they cannot bend to the other

``The science of global warming, for example, cannot dictate policy outcomes, because all knowledge is uncertain especially when it deals with creative human beings, democracies depend on persuading majorities, and no practical system has resources to cover all risks''

``Too many scholars forget the uncertainties of their knowledge and speak too glibly about truth'' (cites and quotes from Weber)

Finishes by challenging political bias which is often ignored. Quotes Bull1972 p263: ``a danger less easy to recognise [than where scholarly values have been subordinated to political ones] is the case where scholarly values are observed, and indeed great intellectual rigour may be displayed, yet within a moral and political framework that is left unquestioned.''},

We find that, since their invention, cars and automobility have killed 60-80 million people and injured at least 2 billion. Currently, 1 in 34 deaths are caused by automobility. Cars have exacerbated social inequities and damaged ecosystems in every global region, including in remote car-free places. While some people benefit from automobility, nearly everyone—whether or not they drive—is harmed by it.

First gives overview of science advice to policy which was originally the role of entrusted government administrator but became more sophisticated first through scientific institutes, science advisors and even multi-lateral organisations such as IPCC and IPBES. The role of science advice now falls to ecosystems of organisations and individuals but based on linear-rational model.

Policy is founded on a plurality of knowledge

Jasanoff and Wynne 1998 suggest that enhanced scientific knowledge rarely resolves policy conflicts

Cairney 2016 and Jasanoff 1994 identify that linear conceptualisation is not reflected in the real world

Values are always embedded in knowledge production

Posit two functions that need to be filled at science-policy interface:
- evidence synthesis - e.g. meta-analysis, model construction [codification?], needs to be unbiased, multi-discipline
- knowledge brokerage - inspired by Pielke2007's Honest Broker:
  - issues advocate - can advance policy although sometimes misrepresent consensus if experts who operate outside their domains and especially are paid to create doubt (e.g. Oreskes and Conway, 2010)
  - honest broker - assist policymakers to make choices between options, provide clarity of evidence

Pielke later implied the ``stealth advocate''

Brokerage must be underpinned by:
- core principles of trust, transparency and legitimacy
- respect for diverse knowledge systems
- acknowledging values and biases

Goes on to give more detail about brokerage organisations and who can perform this role

Also ``public-facing evidence brokerage'' (science communicator?)

Recommendations for effective brokerage:
1. consider the demand (policy) side and policy dynamics of the issue [Bisbal2024 cites McNie2007 for this]
2. recognise the policy question, purpose and evidence need
3. think about the framing - is the right question being asked?
4. assess the evidence base (quantity and quality of available evidence)
5. assess the knowledge gaps
6. communicate the uncertainties, caveats and reliability of evidence
7. identify constraints on scientific claims - inferential gap between knowledge and conclusions
8. evaluate the level of `consensus'
10. ensure comprehension in the presentational approach - it must be useful to the policymaker},

- Pure scientist - generating facts with no consideration of their use
- Science artbiter - answers questions posed by decision-makers
- Science communicator - engages with society to present results, offer expert interpretation and draw attention to implications
- Honest broker of policy alternatives - contributes expertise to decision-making (in co-production)
- Issue advocate - engages with decision makers and public to promote a particular course of action, based on expert knowledge [a kind of policy entrepreneur?]

Foundation is Lubchenco speech of 1997 [discussed in LubchencoR2020] and also using The Honest Broker from Roger Pielke Jr. (Pielke2007 all but science communicator)

``fundamentally, there is a lack of a formal mechanism by which climate scientists can discuss these issues or receive training for roles that are additional to their scientific research''

Note that objectivity is achieved in science by the scrutiny of hostile cooperation of scientists (Popper)

Personalised storytelling is valuable to the communicator (Corner and Groves, 2014)

Some see impartiality compromised by issue advocate role, others ``argue that a climate scientist's specialist knowledge, acquired at the taxpayers' expense, constitutes an obligation to speak out''

  comment          = {Constructivist approach to understanding boundary work as an endeavour within multiple levels in society. This ultimately explains why boundary organisations are not a ``silver bullet'' because their success depends on:
- the (inter)national political culture regarding the status and role of science in policymaking
- the culture of the policy domain
- the characteristics of the policy problem itself
- the role of the relevant boundary organization and its activities
- the framing of the policy problem (defines the need for science)
- path dependency is also evident from how the organisation was set up

`` it is not possible to formulate definitive prescriptions or `best practice' on boundary organizations or boundary work'' - but it seems difficult for boundary organisations to give up this goal

academic endeavours have three interwoven elements: 
- descriptive (“what is actually happening”)
- analytical (“how can we understand what is happening”)
- prescriptive (“how can we improve the situation”)

``closely intertwined because a researcher's descriptive, analytical, and normative perspectives on science-politics relations determine what (s)he observes, how (s)he analyses the observations and what prescriptions (s)he proposes''

Problem structuring theory - two dimensions:
- puzzling - expert side - certainty of knowledge
- powering - political/policy side - agreement on goals

 result in 4 types of problem:
 - structured problems - low puzzling low powering; akin to RittelW1073 tame problems
 - moderately structured problems, goals agreed - high puzzling low powering
 - moderately structured problems, means agreed - low puzzling high powering
 - unstructured problems - high puzzling high powering; akin to RittelW1973 wicked problems
 
 Boundary work has constrasting features:
 coordination between puzzling and powering to co-produce solutions - profane 
 demarcation between puzzling and powering to maintain objectivity - sacred
 
 [MidgleyMB1998 use the distinction between sacred and profane slightly differently but I wonder if they can be considered the same?]
 
Balancing act between credibility and usefulness
 
4 activities needed for policy problem processing (occur at multiple levels in society):
- problem framing
- problem structuring
- knowledge and actor selection
- regulating relations between science and society

levels in society, influence is between adjacent levels, each is described in detail:
1. macro-level - political-cultural sphere - determined by political culture and regulatory style - Renn created typology of these spheres
2. meso-level - policy problem networks - information, communication, resource and power result in networks specilising in particular policy issue - typology is based on problem structuring and uses policy coalition/community theories (see policy issue politics below)
3. boundary organizations - between professional-academic networks and public/policy organisation - 3 features: double participation, dual accountability, use of boundary objects
4. micro-level - policy advice and implementation projects - e.g. statements for policymakers from IPCC, CRELE model fits here

policy issue politics are structured using the puzzling/powering model, tensions arise if problem is dealt with in the wrong way (wrong-problem problem):
- structured problems - regulatory policy in closed professional/technical community
- moderately structured problems, goals agreed - advocacy coalition politics and/or problem-driven search, in oligopolistic policy subsystems
- moderately structured problems, means agreed - discourse coalition politics, accommodation strategies, or conflict management in designed issue network(s)
- unstructured problems - agenda-changing politics, crisis management; deliberation and learning in emergent network(s)

Failure to solve environmental crises is failure to to recognise that these are less structured problems (Funtowicz/Ravetz)

``There is overwhelming evidence that responses to (new) policy developments are influenced by political cultures and regulatory styles in the political-cultural sphere ... For example, Jordan, Benson, Wurzel, and Zito (2011) clearly show how policy instrument design in European climate change governance is strongly influenced by national policy styles and cultures''

Links wicked problems and public value. Goes on to question how public governance can be changed to include all affected interests - including local, national and global sphere?

Uses example of forced migration to describe how different discourse coalitions can exist, particularly with wicked problems e.g.:
- human rights, safety and welfare of individual refugees
- protecting national economic, welfare, sociocultural and security interests

Framework has two dimensions (philosophical traditions and levels of experience), each with two aspects.

Moore's ``Recognizing Public Value'' (2013) recognises two philosophical traditions that relate to values [MestreAWRS202X have these plus two further schools of ethics]:
- consequentialism - utilitarian, judged by welfare of individuals
- deontological - principle, judged by consistency with ideas about justice, fairness, etc 

These philosophical traditions can be evaluated at 
- individual, or 
- collective, 
level of experience resulting in 4 quadrants for evaluating public value creation 

A discourse is likely to call attention to only a subset of these values - paper suggests that there are issues for which current policies lie inside the production possibility frontier meaning that improvements can be made on all the dimensions

Go on to consider complexities of the institutional/political dimension:
- organisations, institutions, sectors etc. have their own practices and logics
- there is no central authority or governance system
- those with responsibility to solve are often those who caused the problem
- media attention can increase rivalry among coalitions making consensus harder to come by

Arbiters of social and public value - who determines value:
- individuals
- individuals voluntarily aligned to other individuals
- citizens subject to law and governance in a political jurisdiction

Objects of social and publuc value - what is valued:
- the material well-being of the valuer
- the material well-being of the others in the society
- the desires of individuals and groups to live up their social duties
- the valuer's ideals of a good and just society

Discusses finding solutions by experimentation and democracy (deliberation) at local (and national) and global (and transnational) scales as well as interconnections to connect all these together - noting the lack of authorising environment at the global scale but also the global and local civil society can influence national states and international organisations},

Suggest considerations and practices that may give decision makers a strategic advantage toward a successful integration of science into decisions:
- be clear about decision context (the demand, not the supply) cites McNie2007 [reflects also GluckmanBK2021, which doesn't cite McNie]
- lead resolutely but listen attentively - avoid the intervention of those who would like exercise control over the framing (such as industrial players, scientists)
- understand the ``best available science'' mandate - there are many facets to what is best, what is available, how other knowledge is integrated
- secure and trust a reliable science provider - e.g. knowledge broker, boundary spanner, etc.
- take a peek in the future - [few citations here, perhaps because its a bit woo]

From the interviews they develop a typology of 3 discourse coalitions:
- analytical - concerned with the explanatory power of different conceptualisations of evidence and policy relations, evidence-based/informed, often organised along disciplinary lines
- advocacy -  more normative and concerned with refining and prescribing idealised kinds of evidence and policy relations that should take place, tend to be somewhat territorial
- application - approaches evidence and policy relations as contingent on context and is concerned with the techniques, conditions and evaluative choices through which these relations are put into practice

For each they describe:
- problem perception
- practices to address that problem
- people involved
- priorities for future development of the domain

Individuals may move between coalitions as part of their roles and arising from different organisations and institutions, and identify that there are benefits to exchange, collaboration and co-mingling between the discourses

Detail how they identified individuals to interview:
- reviewed the Snapshot of the Evidence Informed Landscape from European Commission in 2017
-  considered potential contributors to be those who had actively engaged and reflected on meta-level questions about the scope, organisation and operation of the field of evidence and policy, through publications, commentaries, talks and workshops
- drew upon prior knowledge of potential contributors who were familiar to the authors from interactions at conferences, workshops and through relevant academic and practitioner networks, notably INGSA

Includes example questions

Some potentially useful citations e.g. reviews of evidence and policy literature (mainly health) - e.g. Oliver, Cairney, Pankhurst

``choice of discourse coalitions in this paper rather than other similar approaches ... stemmed from an initial interest in the discursive framing of evidence and policy relations through distinct terminologies, such as evidence-based policy or evidence-informed decision making ... builds upon constructivist traditions (Phillips and Hardy, 2002) by suggesting that language is the primary means through which different actors articulate their perception of a given problem and position themselves in relation to it, as well as to each other''

Some cracking quotes from named interviewees - well worth returning to!

Paul Cairney: ``if you had studied politics, you would know that science is often privileged [in policy making], but it's just not as central to the discussion as someone who is ensconced in science might think''},

Emissions calculators reduce individual to role of consumer, but there are other roles in 6 domains:
- energy in the home
- transport
- shopping
- influence - volunteering, career, talking, etc
- citizenship - voting, investing, activism
- food

Human behaviour models tend to distinguish between two influences, with more psychology focus on the first, although evidence is that this distinction is often blurred:
- intrinsic (values, personality traits, and abilities) and 
- extrinsic (norms, meanings, and material and political structures)

This work identifies 4 main sources of influence (each with references):
- individual
  - psychological - values, traits, skills
  - demographic - education, social advantage (group)
- social
  - cultural - norms, social pressure, role models, aspiration
  - social capital - community organisations, social networks
- physical
  - material - income and wealth, assets, availability of products
  - spatial - access to infrastructure (transport, utilities)
- political
  - governance and democracy - devolution, citizens assemblies, rights to protest, freedom of press, ...

The first message was either a neutral (control) newspaper article or a threat-based article describing findings of a new report. The second message was a ``solution'' policy initiative article with iether a gain or loss frame.

Great overviews of science of emotions:
- emotional response to threat - threat messages evoke fear, conflict about whether a fear response to a climate change message persuades individuals to act
- emotional response to efficacy appeals - efficacy messages mostly evoke hope but there is difference between liberals and moderates, and conservatives
- emotional flow - progression of multiple emotions such as fear to hope

Also gives overviews of different framings of climate change:
- gain/loss framing [more nuanced results are given in low- and high- power loss/gain in Kahneman2011]
- gain/loss framing in climate change ``gain and loss framing effects are likely better explained by accounting for mediating and moderating contextual and affective forces ... emotion''
- framing and emotions - emotions as frames

Found:
- Gain-framed climate change efficacy information elicit more hope than loss-framed efficacy information
- Loss-framed climate change efficacy information elicit more fear than gain-framed efficacy information
- The effects of efficacy information framing on climate change attitudes and advocacy behaviors were mediated by message-generated emotional arousal (hope or fear)
- Exposure to the threat-based message led to greater hope after exposure to the solutions-oriented efficacy message, regardless of how it was framed

the intensity of fear experienced from reading the threatening message influenced the intensity of both fear and hope in response to reading the subsequent solution-oriented efficacy message

Greater persuasive effect was achieved through the sequencing of emotional experiences - I understand that the greatest persuasion was with the first message being fear-inducing and the second being hope-framed efficacy},

`` academic research is not cutting through; for example, the voluntary sector outperforms the higher education sector in terms of written and oral evidence submissions to committees in Parliament'' (too late, poorly presented, overly technical). Improvements suggested:
- better communication and presentation of research
- understanding of, and engagement in, parliamentary processes
- provision of relevant research - e.g. build relationships with knowledge brokers (POST set up collaboration described in POST2022)
- enhance credibility

``thought is needed on how to communicate to parliamentarians and their staff what research evidence is, and how other forms of `research' might differ from a methodological point of view''},

Cleanly outlines UK state powers (legislature, executive, judiciary) and other kinds of public body that use research, what those uses are, and all the direct and indirect ways that research impacts policy. 

The aim is to define a means to define research impact on policy for REF 2021, and the reasons why this is difficult are also outlines.

Could be useful to return to for structuring frameworks, interviews, etc.

Impact in all areas (not just policy) is measured in terms of ``Reach'' and ``Significance''

1. The current state of trust in climate science and climate scientists
2. Reasons for distrust
3. How political engagement affects trust
 
Trust in scientists not affected by their respectful advocacy for greater climate action but their credibility may be affected by advocating for a specific policy (section 4) (see also papers in DablanderSCSBGGBAH2024)

Perceptions of scientists' large carbon footprint have a negative affect on their credibility

Scientists considered more trustworthy if they were advocating for policy that respondent already supported

Greater trustworthiness perceptions may be gained by demonstrating competence, benevolence, integrity, and openness:
- integrity - walk the walk by reducing their personal carbon footprints, especially if they advocate for carbon footprint reductions
- benevolence - can be increased by public and political engagement, especially when advocating for policies with high public support
- benevolence - providing prosocial motivations in scientist biographies
- openness - being transparent about their funding and data sources, and by declining funding from sources that entail obvious conflicts of interest

These work differently for different audiences

Emotion of research may impact trustworthiness, with angry being less persuasive than sad, but not by much and the emotion of the audience matters (more research needed on emotions [I think Aaron Thierry is looking at this])

Political leaning of audience also matters, conservative republicans trust primary care doctors and television weather forecasters more than climate scientsts - suggest communicating with intermediaries not just directly with public},

Very clearly written apparently thorough report of the possiblities for GGR. 

Some of the citations used are rather old and I wonder if they are still relevant

Test out the options with ascenarios: ``considered a plausible, albeit highly challenging, route to net-zero emissions'' ``with many methods deployed at the limit of their maximum deployment''

GGR methods:
- Forestation
- Habitat restoration
- Soil carbon sequestration - changing land management
- Biochar
- Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) 
- Ocean fertilisation
- Building with biomass
- Enhanced terrestrial weathering
- Mineral carbonation - injecting GHG into rocks in or ex situ
- Ocean alkalinity
- Direct air capture and carbon storage (DACCS) 
- Low-carbon concrete
- other approaches are also briefly described
- approaches to removing GHGs other than CO2 are also described

Detail is given on each is provided in chapter 2, including technology readiness, scalability and engineering challenges, and social and policy factors (discussion and examples of social and policy contexts of each method)

Chapter 3 discusses cross-cutting issues: resources, storage, environment, science and technology, economics, legislation, social aspects

Figure 3 shows all these approaches - DACCS stands out as a minor player [but I would argue is what most people think of as GGR]

First recommendation is to continue and increase efforts to reduce GHG emissions

Recommendations include importing sustainable biomass

Need to (p 82) ``ensure more level incentives at the margin for GGR and to pump-prime the CCS market, overcoming `first of a kind' costs and investment hold-up problems'', options:
- carbon pricing
- regulation standards
- obligation on fossil fuel companies

There's a diagram (Figure 3) in the summary, not the main report, that appears to indicate more than 50\% of something will be done with BECCS and DACCS - this is under the Net-zero in 2050 scenario. The curious thing here is that these two technologies are ``requiring CCS'' but neither ``ready for deployment'' nor ``not yet demonstrated at scale''.

`` CCS is largely at the demonstration stage''
``Bioenergy is already supported in many national policy frameworks''
``The ecological impacts of ocean fertilisation on the marine food web and fisheries, and the downstream effects on nutrient supply, productivity and food web dynamics are extremely difficult to predict [e.g.] Some iron fertilisation experiments have demonstrated that toxin-producing algae may be stimulated, leading to `harmful algal blooms' that can be toxic to wildlife and humans''
``A rigorous cost-benefit analysis including co-benefits has not yet been performed''
``It is estimated that [DACCS] currently lie between pilot plant development and prototype demonstration in the field''
``The technology and storage requirements of DACCS are similar to those of power generation and CCS and so the timescale of ramp-up will also be comparable''
``Large scale deployment by 2050, with early deployment in 2030, should be possible from a technical point of view'' [unreferenced?]
``Many GGR technologies could be economically profitable with carbon prices in the 2030 recommended range of $50 to $100 per tCO2''
``Efforts to deploy GGR technologies can be economically and environmentally counterproductive if spatial [e.g. impacts of growing crops for GGR] and temporal [e.g. efforts delay but don't solve problem] `leakage' effects are not considered''
``Given the short timeframe on which deployment is required, governments may choose to directly intervene in markets. This might alleviate the high costs associated with `first of a kind' activities, while building experience in the sector and enabling any associated economic spillovers''
`` There are too many variables and uncertainties for these to provide absolute solutions, However they present plausible, though not necessarily optimal or desirable, future worlds in which ambitious efforts are made to limit climate change using GGR''},

  abstract         = {Abstract Carbon dioxide removal is rapidly becoming a key focus in climate research and politics. This is raising concerns of “moral hazard” or “mitigation deterrence,” that is, the risk that promises of and/or efforts to pursue carbon removal end up reducing or delaying near-term mitigation efforts. Some, however, contest this risk, arguing that it is overstated or lacking evidence. In this review, we explore the reasons behind the disagreement in the literature. We unpack the different ways in which moral hazard/mitigation deterrence (MH/MD) is conceptualized and examine how these conceptualizations inform assessments of MH/MD risks. We find that MH/MD is a commonly recognized feature of modeled mitigation pathways but that conclusions as to the real-world existence of MH/MD diverge on individualistic versus structural approaches to examining it. Individualistic approaches favor narrow conceptualizations of MH/MD, which tend to exclude the wider political-economic contexts in which carbon removal emerges. This exclusion limits the value and relevance of such approaches. We argue for a broader understanding of what counts as evidence of delaying practices and propose a research agenda that complements theoretical accounts of MH/MD with empirical studies of the political-economic structures that may drive mitigation deterrence dynamics. This article is categorized under: The Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Benefits of Mitigation The Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Sociology/Anthropology of Climate Knowledge Policy and Governance > Multilevel and Transnational Climate Change Governance},
  comment          = {Review of literature considering whether there is a moral hazard / mitigation delay (MH/MD) caused by developing GGR technologies. Great for literature on GGR and policy and understanding the balance of the arguments around this. Section 4 is especially good for this.

3 types of literature:

- the role of CDR in IAMs, where there is general agreement that MH/MD exists, yet disagreement as to whether this results in real-world MH/MD - tends to agree that inclusion of CDR substitutes for reduction
- attempts to assess MH/MD risks outside of models:
  - MH/MD as an expression of individualist preferences, choices, and actions - tends to find little evidence for MH/MD
  - MH/MD as the outcome of structural dynamics in society - indicates that there may be MH/MD and there is a need for a structural understanding of MH/MD

``a now extensive literature argues that specific assumptions made across IAMs result in modeled mitigation pathways that downplay the need and opportunities for phasing out fossil fuels, which in turn may inspire political complacency''

Literature considering structural dynamics ``suggests that a combination of economic and political commitments to existing infrastructures and energy strategies is creating path dependencies that make non-CDR pathways seem unfeasible'' - incumbent actors (dominant interests) are releived of their reponsibility to reduce emissions now

``a substantial literature discusses structural mitigation deterrence dynamics, drawing on a wide range of backgrounds and concepts, and often describing MH/MD as an outcome of neoliberal capitalism''

``Historical accounts suggest that there was a shared understanding among influential industrialists, scientists, and politicians as early as the late 1980s that anthropogenic climate change was a real concern and that action was needed''

``The literature reviewed for this article, collectively suggests that a key impediment to successful climate mitigation over the past three decades is the pervasive failure to [question many of the core tenets of modern, industrialized societies]''

Review this through 9 lenses, each undertaken by relevant experts:
1. international climate governance
2. the vested interests of the fossil fuel industry
3. geopolitics and militarism (manifest in global extractivism)
4. economics and financialization
5. mitigation modeling
6. energy supply systems
7. inequity
8. high-carbon lifestyles - attempts to influence behaviour aren't working, many high-carbon activities are habitual
9. social imaginaries

``power emerged as a particularly important thread to emphasize''

Power described in different forms:
- Davos cluster - embedded unchallanged power - lenses 1, 2, and 3
- Enabler cluster - instrumental power, responses to all issues can be addressed within the contemporary socioeconomic paradigm, but with the power to undermine the status quo - lenses 4, 5 and 6
- Ostrich and Phoenix cluster - the power of ideas, experimentation and cultural change if willing to take head out of the sand - lenses 7, 8, and 9

``economic schools, whether orthodox or heterodox, have generally failed to incorporate biophysical reality''

Some nice discussions of integrated assessment models IAMs - sections 4.1 (lens 4) and 4.2 (lens 5)

``a new environmental asset class is now being created that includes so-called green securitizations of carbon offsets and natural disaster insurance---catastrophe, or cat, bonds ... As with carbon markets, cat bonds have thus far failed to live up to their promises of providing protection and raise major ethical concerns, such as exacerbating the severe and already unequal distribution of climate impacts''

``Since the fourth IPCC assessment report, IAMs have become heavily reliant on large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR), or negative emissions. To date, IAMs have included two forms of CDR: afforestation (AF) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), with work ongoing to include other approaches (such as direct air capture and storage)''

Mechanism related to inequity:
1. decouples the vulnerable from the powerful
2. erodes social trust required for collective action
3. reinforces the preference of elites for a status quo hostile to climate action

There are scarce plausible social imaginaries because:
1. construction of new imaginaries builds on existing representationsm which are ``deeply entangled with fossil fuels''
2. ``with technocratic forms of modeling, cost-benefit analysis, and forecasting at the core of most governmental and industrial imaginaries, the future continues to be framed as open to exploitation''
3. ``certain visions of the future are actively marginalized and different groups' capacity to imagine better futures systematically eroded''},

3 potential obstacles to climate action by local governments:
1. underestimate constituency support for climate action
2. time horizon required to implement environmental reforms
3. credibility of the actors disseminating new climate solutions

Experimented with invitations to webinar sent out to politicians in local governments in France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, UK and US

Invitations varied to appeal to the 3 obstacles, variations were in 3 fully crossed factors (4 or 8 versions of the invitation, depending on country):
1. included local-level public opinion data on climate (only in UK and US due to data availability) (2 versions)
2. highlighted the long- or the short-term policy effects of the policies (2 versions)
3. were sent on behalf of a climate scientist or a peer legislator (2 versions)

Used marketing tool to capture clicks on emails, and and follow up email, to measure:
- policy interest (1 or more clicks)
- policy engagement (the number of clicks)
- policy commitments (click to join Race to Zero)

Draw the following conclusions (although looking at the data, I don't see very strong trends):
- no evidence that the lack of action on climate change is driven by politicians systematically underestimating voter preferences
- providing public opinion information did make legislators more responsive
- preliminary evidence that altering the time horizon of climate policies by highlighting more short-term policy consequences can encourage legislators to learn more about net zero policies
- politicians exhibit greater interest in the event when contacted by policy experts [climate scientist], with the exception of US officials},

return to if discussing advocacy

covers:
- the established role of scientists in society and four conceptualized roles of a scientist in public policy making
- the role of scientists in biodiversity conservation, building on long-running debate in the field of conservation biology
- the impact of the institutional setting on science and scientists, comparing academia with environmental non-governmental organizations (eNGOs), using the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) as a case study
- the challenges and risks at the coalface of science and policy
- ask whether it is enough for scientists to be detached `honest brokers' in policy formation and suggest a way forward.

Uses Pielke2007's roles at the policy interface (see RapleyD2014 and GluckmanBK2021):
- pure scientist
- science arbiter
- issue advocate
- honest broker of policy alternatives
- add honest advocate [which turns out to have been previously identified in RoseBOP2018]

place these roles on 2 axes:
- potential to have policy influence
- potential risk to scientific credibility

``Pielke also observes that `Pure Scientist' and `Science Arbiters' can, inadvertently or intentionally, slip into 'stealth mode' and act as advocates should they begin to present information that is partial or biased''

``Many scientists in academia would resemble a Science Arbiter in Pielke's model' ... will also act regularly as Honest Brokers ... a small but growing number of high-profile academics also act vocally as Issue Advocates on both climate and nature''. Later say that taking on issue advocate role can undermine confidence in science but question if it is enough for scientists to be solely honest brokers given the urgency and complexity of the challenge. 

``RSPB scientists resemble Honest Brokers''

``the risk to scientific credibility might be equally high if scientists failed to engage actively in advocacy too, especially when they judge threats to be extreme''

Discusses Richard Pearson's book `Driven to Extinction' and how it is concerned about ``crying wolf'' [false positive]

Notes that conservation science differs from medical science, in which the ``mission to do good sits easily'' and there is little moral panic if scietists share policy goals

``the Scientific Method Is Characterized By Accuracy, Precision, Repeatability And Impartiality, And Uses Communal Mechanisms Such As Critiques, Peer Review, Open Discussion, Conferences And Independent Assessment To Scrutinize, Validate And Update Scientific Claims''

1. there will be no climate protection policies - we've failed to prevent climate collapse 
2. climate collapse has begun - the process of moving into an unstable state has begun - therefore we need a new strategy
3. fascism is rising around the globe and is a clear and present danger

On collapse: 31:20
- fascists have been preparing for collapse
- magical-thinking leftists have not
- social agents will arise to organise systems as they collapse, gaps left by the state or market - these will be by the fascists or the left (solidarist, universalist and open)
- therefore we need to organise for the latter - a Just Collapse

``Dr Knorr explains that climate science is not a 'hard science' but involves subjective choice that perpetuates the prejudices of elites. That is partly why the profession focuses on the noise not the signal, the secondary not the salient''

``former IPCC chair Bob Watson admitting that the iron rule that bad news must be packaged in cheery optimism has now once and for all been thoroughly refuted''

``because they are so siloed, middle class, and technocratic, both the climate movement and profession are not aligned with humanity's other major concerns and social trends. Therefore, they risk becoming an agent of authoritarianism''

Useful outline of agency. Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 2001) suggests that people need to feel they can influence to be incentivised to act. There are 3 types of agency:
- personal - preferred - but if too much responsibility, may turn to:
- proxy - individual enlists external resources to reduce burden
- collective - team with shared goal

Aim to identify how environmental researchers engage with policy theory

Useful for references to work that considers:
- just climate policy
- how climate researchers establish feasible pathways to policy change
- how climate researchers use key theories as part of a framework to assess climate governance
- what researchers are looking for and what they find regarding policy

Find that, unlike review of health research, there is little use of policy theory to seek practical lessons such as how to advocate for policy change

Call for climate-related policy research to be more informed by policy theory. Insights of value to climate justice research:
1. major policy change is rare and difficult to predict
2. policy making is subject to bounded rationality
3. policymakers operate in complex environment

``While theory-informed studies do not solve the problems raised by climate justice scholars, they provide the concepts or language to help identify patterns and mechanics of policy change, which should help to raise research questions pertinent to the ongoing study of climate change action''

More detailed results on 
- the amount of attention to climate justice in governance
- different definitions of climate justice (and who wins and loses)
- the policy changes that researchers seek
  - transformation of systems of governance
  - mainstreaming of justice / policy integration
  - organise to overcome neoliberalism
  - design effective policy tools
- the policy changes that researchers find:
  - includes a list of examples of knowledge policy gaps
- how researchers use policy theory

Identifies strategies of PEs, some normative principles and from this derive democratic deficiencies of PEs.

Particularly covers liberal democracies and deliberative democracies and considers many are liberal with deliberative aspects.

Great literature review covering theories of policy entrepreneurs, their motives and strategies. Also the theories of legitimacy, accountability and justice in liberal and deliberative democracies.

Detail describing, particularly, recent polical upheavals in Sweden around popularism and climate denialism of political (public sector) actors (including evidence of troll factories, orchestration by neoliberal Atlas network).

``policy entrepreneurs do not only impact agenda-setting, policy preferences, and policies and their outcomes, but also procedures and normative principles of liberal and deliberative democratic governance---positively or negatively, intentionally or unintentionally.''

PE approaches to policy change - using strategies:
- Attention and support seeking strategies - Problem framing; idea generation. Strategic dissemination of information. Lead by example; use demonstration projects. Rhetorical persuasion; media attention. Exploitation of focusing event(s).
- Linking strategies - Coalition and team building with bureaucratic insiders and policy influencers outside of government. Issue linking. Game linking.
- Relational management strategies - Networking by using social acuity. Trust building. 
- Arena strategies - Venue shopping. Timing.

Critical of Mintrom's uncritical discussion of the need for more policy entrepreneurs

The model of policy entrepreneurship, that PEs are a fact and are (should be) part of the political process fails to address questions of legitimacy, accountability, justice

Identifies six interrelated democratic norms and principles, on which should be based critical research on the role of policy entrepreneurs in, and their impact on, liberal and deliberative democracies:
1. legitimacy - input, throughput and output legitimacy 
2. accountability
3. transparency and publicity
4. openness and equality
5. impartiality and fairness
6. justice - procedural and distributive

Relates 3-6 to 1 and 2 in table 2

Use this framework to analyse two cases and revises the model of strategic behaviour and impacts to include political ideology in the context and influencing motvies.

Go on to suggest that interest groups such as Fridays for Future (FFF) and Extinction Rebellion (XR) are not invited to the table because they don't offer solutions - and that they should therefore propose solutions. yet acknowledges that such groups cannot easily meet at the hegemonic environmental democracy as they see it as part of the problem.


``there is a lack of systematic research on whether the presence of policy entrepreneurs has a positive or negative impact on democracy and different democratic values and norms'' - a proposes a series of questions for consideration

Lobbyism is related to policy entrepreneurism and much better known 

Classes climate change among the ``more pervasive public policy issues [for which] public executives and legislators [are] more open for advocacy of stakeholders from different sectors and social spheres''

``Success is not only determined by the characteristics, actions, and strategies of policy entrepreneurs, but also the context which shapes their actions''

``illiberal and antidemocratic actors using democratic institutions and functions to reach their Ultimate Goal''

policy entrepreneur concept was introduced by Robert A. Dahl in the 1960s and popularized by John W. Kingdon in the 1980s},

Using data from 125 interviews, we ask: How are foundational experts contesting the conduct of anticipatory assessment of carbon removal and solar geoengineering – as two emerging but controversial strategies for engaging with climate change and achieving Net Zero targets? We find that efforts at carbon removal and solar geoengineering assessment leverage and challenge systems modeling that has become dominant in mapping and communicating future climate impacts and mitigation strategies via IPCC reports. Both suites of climate intervention have become stress-tests for the capacity of modeling to assess socio-technical strategies with complex, systemic dimensions. Meanwhile, exploring societal dimensions demands new modes of disciplinary expertise, qualitative and deliberative practices, and stakeholder inclusion that modelling processes struggle to incorporate. Finally, we discuss how the patterns of expert contestation identified in our results speak to multiple fault-lines within ongoing debates on reforming global environmental assessments, and highlights key open questions to be addressed.},

  comment          = {Consider 4 models of research-policy relations:
1. research -> policy - supply model - knowledge shapes policy
2. research <- policy/politics - political power shapes knowledge
3. research <o> policy - research knowledge and governance are co-produced  through ongoing mutual constitution - co-production [note - technologies of hubris]
4. research -> | <- policy - there is no overarching causality - politics selectively appropriates and gives meaning to scientific findings - autonomous spheres

Discusses each with reference to literature

1. knowledge shapes policy - common conceptualisation, behind evidence-based policymaking, gap between research and policy communties due to e.g. poor communication of research. Suggest that a better approach would be for multiple authors to develop policy messages from diverse studies - this is very different to current impact pathways - ``widely debunked''
2. politics shapes knowledge - power relations are implicated in construction of expert authority, powerful interests shape research process, commissioned research cannot be independent, policy institutions and procedures shape engagement [e.g. CalverleyA2022 Carton2021], naïve to assume that researchers can speak truth to power
3. co-production - Jasanoff knowledge making is inherent in state-making, performativity, new techniques bring about new epistemologies, technologies of hubris, thus cannot neatly identify impact, research may create problems while solving problems
4. autonomous spheres - ``science and politics are separate function-systems'', how do the systems pick up and give meaning to signals from each other?, how does the politics system model the science system? garbage-can model? is research taken up by politics to signal legitimacy rather than for informing policy?

Nature of measures such as REF is that they are based on simply linear concept of research-policy relations, that impact can and should be measured:
- can lead to gaming and `impact mercantalism'
- if 4 is the case: ``the impact agenda has been designed to suit the needs of a political, rather than scientific, system and should be treated cautiously by researchers given its potential to divert science from its core task of developing truth claims''
- if 2 or 4, incentivising impact is flawed, decoupled from research quality
- research impact ``involves subtle, incremental and diffuse ideational adjustments over a long period of time, which are generated by a wide range of research insights rather than specific individual findings'', should reward collaborative endeavours},

Basic Five Paragraph Model of Introduction

The following is a very simple illustration of the "five paragraph model of introductions." It does not always need to be five paragraphs; some of these can be consolidated for shorter pieces. The idea is to present the overview, background, issue, results, and roadmap as a way to:
- convey the overall setup and outcomes of the paper
- convince the reader this is coherent, grounded in theory and evidence, and worth reading the whole paper.

The five paragraph model typically comprises the following:

1. Overview of the paper
  - Problem
  - Challenge/issue
  - How analyzed/solved
  - Transition to background
2. Background
  - Origins of problem
  - Economic, social, political, and/or technical factors at play
  - What previous analyses tell us about problem
  - Transition from previous analyses to current
3. Challenge and Issues
  - Current challenge/issue being addressed
  - Why different from background
  - What makes this challenge/issue analysis different (cases, model, conceptual framework, some combination of these)
  - Transition from what contributes to analysis to how conducted
4. How Analysis Was Conducted and Summary of Results
  - How was the analysis conducted (integration of framework, cases, and/or conceptual framework)
  - Summarize interesting points in the analysis
  - Summarize conclusions
  - Transition to how we got here (Roadmap)
5. Roadmap
  - How does this paper develop this analysis and these conclusions?

``There is still a culture of dismissiveness towards social science ... not afforded the same epistemic authority''

``...broken record ... `it's a bit more complicated than that; you've forgotten about class, gender, power, etc' ''

Advisers want to have impact but it has different meanings for different advisers, they learn:
- becoming bilingual - literacy and the two cultures
- knowing your place - limits to advisers agency and situatedness in the ecosystem of science advice
- embracing nonlinearity
- recognising impact's many shapes e.g. a trusted relationship with a policymaker can be impactful in and of itself},

Some proposed solutions, like teaching scientists to communicate more effectively, can be helpful, but are not necessarily sufficient. Instead, connecting science and policy may often require a separate kind of expert: full-time intermediaries who facilitate the complicated exchange of information among scientists, policy-makers, and other stakeholders. In this paper, we describe intermediary efforts by the Lenfest Ocean Program, a grant-making program that funds peer-reviewed research and connects scientists and decision-makers who can take action on an issue. We present case studies of intermediary work on three topics: first, sustainable methods of harvesting bull kelp in the US Pacific Northwest; second, the design of catch share programs in US fisheries; and third, management of forage fish. These case studies suggest that science-policy intermediaries can help scientists make meaningful contributions to public discourse.}},

``connecting science and policy is not a part-time, `do it yourself' enterprise, but instead benefits from the skills and experience of practitioners who are immersed in the process''

Noting how much effort doing science brokerage is, ``We suggest that a separate kind of expert---one who has the time and expertise to engage with both science and policy---can play a vital role at this interface that scientists themselves rarely can. This is the aspiration of science-policy intermediaries, or boundary organizations. These are enterprises and individuals that specialize in facilitating the complicated and erratic flow of information among scientists, policy-makers, and various stakeholders, while generally refraining from advocating for specific policy positions.'' brokers for scientific information (ref Pielke2007 and Meyer 2010 [The rise of the knowledge broker]. Identifies the skill sets useful here:
- Knowledge of a particular scientific field
- Strategic grant-making capability
- Analytical skills to critically appraise evidence and synthesize multiple lines of research
- Writing skills
- Creative design skills
- Policy expertise related to pertinent laws, regulations, and administrative agencies to identify information needs
- Knowledge of social science theory related to decision-making and impact assessment
- Communication expertise
- Integrative capacity, or specialized generalists who can identify opportunities to connect science and policy and coordinate an overall science-policy outreach strategy

section 4.1 nice summary of the kinds of strategies for scientists that are found literature
section 4.2 measuring impact is difficult in any complex setting

An early project demonstrated how difficult it is to trace knowledge input to policy outcomes. A later project led them to consider metrics of success

Through learning, developed many different means to convey information into policy ``intermediary efforts'' that include summaries of reports, fact sheets, videos, media outreach, briefings, and presentations to many different stakeholders

``our intermediary efforts were successful in informing a variety of discussions and influencing some policy changes''

Further, these materials were used by some Indigenous communities to advocate for more sustainable fisheries

But this wasn't enough - thus undertook a retrospective assessment interviews, surveys, etc to understand how and why decision makers and advocate used their findings and what could be improved for different users

``strategies [ensure that their results are clear, relevant, timely, credible, and sensitive to stakeholder needs and perspectives, being better communicators and more policy literate, and presenting `actionable' and `usable' research to stakeholders] alone are not necessarily sufficient to ensure that science and policy integration occurs, and they present quite a workload. As we have suggested through the examples in this paper, the efforts required in the enterprise of connecting science and policy can often exceed the skill sets or time constraints of individual scientists''},

- Politics of Science - particularly from international relations, Hoppe et al 2017, epistemic communities, legitimacy and legitimation
- Critical Visions - STS and integration of insights from different fields, Jasanoff and the need to integrate different epistemologies, power, pervasiveness of Western epistemologies, situated knowledge and mutual learning
- Hybrid Approaches

Held 3 workshops within their organisation to discuss the findings of the literature.

Scientists found ``usable knowledge'' too simplistic, identifying instead with ``politics of science'' perspective in a setting of complex governance. ``Our scientists recognized that interventions took place in a knowledge system inserted in a society with profound and stable patterns of social, political and cultural practice, forming the rules of a civic epistemology''

Found that excellent, relevance, credibility, legitimacy are necessary but not suffiient precursers for taking a seat at the table in climate governance. That need the organisation to be proactively involved with shared values and ``the country's civic epistemology, with believes in a duty of science to serve the country''},

  abstract         = {{The demand for geoscience to inform policy decisions continues to rise. For science to effectively inform policy, scientists must have training that enhances their understanding of the movement of knowledge across boundaries, e.g., between science and policy. This training should be based on existing perceptions scientists at all career stages have about potential roles they might play. In this study, geoscientists’ drawings of their perceptions of the diffusion of science into policy were collected and salient features were coded. For comparison, four expert models were also collected from individuals with extensive experience working at the interface between science and policy. A principal component analysis identified common patterns in the relationships depicted in the geoscientists’ drawings, resulting in five distinctive models describing different perceived roles scientists might play in the diffusion of science into policy: a beacon informing decisions, a collaborator working alongside policymakers to co-produce knowledge, an educator enhancing the capacity of society in the classroom and media, an outcast whose efforts to inform are rejected, and an investigator whose research may or may not be used depending on how others interpret it. Increasing the effectiveness of scientists’ engagements requires enhancing their ability to understand potential roles that they might play; understanding what roles are most appropriate for them; and discerning how they can best fulfill these roles in their work. Suggestions for cultivating this capacity are offered based on the expert models and a discussion of guided reflection within experiential learning in the classroom and beyond.}},

Identified salient elements and themes in drawings to identify 16 codes in 3 groups:
- supply-side
- point of exchange
- demand-side

These were found to be consistent with the literature

Used PCA [and some tweaking e.g. removing those with lower factor loadings] to identify 5 components which feature various codes - define these as models for which they create a description for each

Models:
A) Beacon Model - ``scientists produce peer-reviewed research and then engage with non-scientists about their findings ... to inform voters about important issues, with the hope that this can lead to more informed policies''

B) Collaborator Model - ``scientists perceive that they contribute to the development of non-scholarly reports and presentations that influence policymakers and the general public. These scientists perceive that they might participate in knowledge systems connecting information with action as colleagues working alongside peers in the policymaking community''

C) Educator Model - ``scientists perceive that scientists influence policy outcomes by acting as teachers in the classroom and in the media, rather than directly participating in knowledge systems connecting information with action ... enhance peoples' exposure to information ... altering the broader social norms, politics, and culture ...''

D) Outcast Model - ``scientists perceive that they produce research they believe has value for society and attempt to inform policymakers and the public about their discoveries, but the policymakers and public ignore the scientists' research because the findings challenge an existing system (e.g., beliefs, interests)''
 
E) Investigator Model - ``scientists perform research on particular issues and publish peer-reviewed papers, but whether their work is used by policymakers is determined by its relevance for use in a particular law or policy. Scientists perceive that they produce information that may or may not enter into a knowledge system connecting information with action''

This comprises 3 activities, each with 4-6 attributes and each attribute has a value range between science (as a closed system) values and user (research is open to engagement) values. Each of these attributes can be understood by a specific question (abbreviated here):
1. knowledge production:
  - expertise - epistemic <-> experiential - who has credibility to product knowledge?
  - relevance - general <-> contextual - how is research relevant to solving specific problem?
  - disciplinary focus - singular, narrow <-> transdisciplinary, diverse - how discipline-driven are the knowledge production activities?
  - uncertainty - reduce uncertainty <-> manage uncertainty - how is uncertainty understood and addressed?
  - goals for research - exploratory <-> outcome oriented - what are the epistemic goals?
2. learning and engagement:
  - learning - theoretical <-> social, practical - how to outputs change knowledge sytem?
  - knowledge exchange - narrow <-> iterative, influential - how much and how is knowledge exchanged?
  - network participation - homogeneous <-> heterogeneous - who participates in the knowledge network?
  - social capital - negligible <-> significant - how important is development and deployment of social capital?
3. organisation and institutional processes: 
  - accessibility - constrained <-> high - how accessible to users are researchers/their organisations/institutions?
  - outputs - narrow <-> diverse - how various are the outputs and outcomes?
  - evaluation and effectiveness - science-centric <-> public-value oriented - what factors shape evaluation?
  - flexibility - constrained <-> responsive - how easy to respond to users' needs?
  - human capital - narrow <-> broad - what skills and training are needed?
  - boundary management - limited <-> broad - how effort is needed to manage the boundary?

Really useful reference for understanding the range of work on science-policy interface - see topics below

But under experiences the impression is very much that it is not about the experience of scientists

Part I: The goal 
- useful information must be salient, credible, legitimate [also Cash et al 2003]

Part II: The lessons of experience
- historical trends - national and international agencies, stakeholder involvement, new institutions, ...
- conditioning factors:
  - policy - endless frontier, linear model, other models
  - civil society - now more engaged
  - science -barriers between science and society, and science and policy: uncertainty, scale differences, culture
  - knowledge and decision systems - need for more social and behavioural understanding

Part III: Alternatives and processes for improving
- alternatives:
  - scientists need to align more to policy needs
  - stakeholders should be included in the decision-making process
  - building social capital - trust, respect, cooperation - between scientists and decision makers
  - scientists and decision makers need to actively manage the boundary
  - strengthen linkages between science and policy
  - improve communication
  - develop new ways of thinking about the process
- process:
  - various participatory approaches
  - adaptive management
  - science shops and community-based research
  - boundary organisations

3. integrating
4. taking a position
5. decision making

Neat history of scientific philosophy from positivist roots, enlightement, Kuhn, Polanyi

Levien 1979 identified 3 roles for scientists:
1. provide a clear understanding of the basic dimensions of environmental problems, identifying both what is known and what is uncertain
2. describe and identify options for the appropriate solution of those problems, some of which might not be considered by political decision makers
3. contribute to the resolution of environmental problems by estimating the economic, social, environmental and political consequences of proposed solutions through time and space, and across population groups

Roles discussed in literature review:
1. traditional - provide relevant expertise about scientific data, theories, and findings that others in the policy-making process can use to make decisions (outgrowth of the Enlightenment and the philosophy of positivism)
2. integrative - scientists should become more integrated into management and policy processes (post-normal science)},

``seeks to understand how forest researchers navigate complex SPIs, and how they respond to the tensions that emerge when there are multiple actors and interests'' identify a gap in research that addresses the tensions that emerge in interactions in policy

Conducted 23 semi-structured 55-80 minute interviews over 4 month period with experienced researchers in an international forest research organisation to analyse how they engaged in forest policy in the Global South at different governance levels perceive and respond to the tensions inherent in SPIs. As well as CRELE framework use inductive coding to identify 15 SPIs across 4 policy levels, 12 additional challenges (e.g. funding, government policies, project management) and 22 response strategies

``more nuanced understanding of the policy context, policy actors and their interlinked relationships is needed ... Deeper understanding of power relations is also crucial, including the sources and types of power, particularly in SPIs where multiple policy actors can claim the right of participation''

Clear write-up of the different areas of tensions and frustration experienced by researchers, e.g.
- being asked to prescribe policy by actors with more power
- disparities and swings in political priorities
- conflict outcomes of research and e.g. government's data or position leading to questioning of the science
- requests to change or remove content of papers or talks
- critical narratives leading to reputational harm for scientist
- country of origin in relation to country of policy having negative and positive effects on scientists' perceived legitimacy
- impact on research of funding and funders

Strategies - to actively manage tensions, e.g.:
- ensuring policy-relevance
- different framings of problems
- self-reflection, humbleness

``propose to understand expertise and evidence as socially embedded in authority relations and cultural contexts''

``policy-relevant facts are the result of an intensive and complex struggle for political and epistemic authority on both sides; science as well as policy ... what counts as evidence is defined by institutionally and discursively''

3 arguments:
1. policy-based evidence making might actually be the flip side of evidence-based policy (evidence-based policy rests on its own mechanisms of exclusion and selectivity)
2. deficits and side effects of evidence-based policy are more visible with more `regulatory science' (research agencies, advicory commissions, etc) - conflicts over the justifiability and accountability of expertise and evidence have emerged
3. the different national contexts are an issue of contestation with globally active science-policy organisations such as IPCC - and trying to find common ground creates concerns about the politicisation of science - `civic epistemologies'

``To understand these dynamics of evidence-based policy immunising itself against criticism and thus turning into policy-based evidence, more comparative research on the `embeddedness' of evidence and expertise is needed. In our paper we give an overview of recent studies that tackle these questions. Furthermore, our aim is to set out the configurations, contexts and mechanisms of policy-based evidence making''

Nice summary of UK evidence policy context

Review of literature on policy-based evidence making - evidence is neglected and distorted because it conflicts with political values and ideologies (normative selectivity) or it is ignored and misinterpreted as a result of limited politico-administrative perception (cognitive selectivity). This is influence by power asymmetries:
- knowledge monopolisation (cognitive selectivity + actor-related asymmetries)
- blame avoidance (normative selectivity + actor-related asymmetries)
- black-boxing (cognitive selectivity + instrument-related asymmetries)
- over-simplification (normative selectivity + instrument-related asymmetries)},

- identifying claims about the science-policy interface
- conducting an assessment of these claims by Science Of Actionable Knowledge (SOAK) researchers
- identifying a a future research agenda for SOAK

SOAK is a meta-research in processes, practices and pathways by which knowledge meaningfully informs action. [Currently, there seem to be only two or publications from this field and the authors of this paper may be all the SOAK researchers referred to by the study - they are based in USA, Canada and Netherlands]

1. identify 26 claims about the science policy interface in the literature which cover:
  - assumptions
  - meaning
  - structure
  - engagement processes
  - outcomes
2. 13 claims were agreed with by expert group, 2 rejected and 11 were neither agreed or disagreed
3. 4 high-level questions for further research, each with subquestions:
  - How do we define and evaluate success in producing actionable knowledge?
  - How do we best situate and support intermediaries to accelerate actionable knowledge production?
  - What is the meaning and role of trust in science-society engagements?
  - Is consensus required for informing policies and what could alternative approaches look like?

Interesting conclusions:
- power, politics, and other governance issues relating to actionable knowledge, are only beginning to be examined
- researchers are hence starting to reframe co-production and other science-society engagements as governance processes that navigate politics and tensions
- need to understand how institutions and efforts can be designed to build mutual accountability, political legitimacy, and trust among participants and within broader societal contexts},

domains of enquiry, builds on BuseMW2012 [but seems to reduce the policy content aspect - which is relevant to my research]:
- Actors/Relationships -- roles, characteristics of and links between researchers, policymakers and other key players
- Research characteristics -- topic, quality, credibility, relevance, timeliness, presentation, etc
- Strategies -- professional influence-orientated behaviours of researchers
- Processes -- how events unfolded, barriers and enablers, case examples
- Context -- the overlapping 'worlds' of policy, politics, practice, research, advocacy, media and public opinion, including organisational and disciplinary cultures, and power structures
- Values -- ethics, traditions, ideology, controversy and vested interests

Weiss 1991 identify that research supports policy as:
- data - used instrumentally to inform policy decisions
- argument - used 
  - strategically to address values and interests, or 
  - symbolically to support, justify or refute predetermined positions
- ideas - that influence the policy climate and agenda-setting by illuminating, supporting and challenging existing paradigms

Nice description of methods

``influential public health researchers are rarely just curiosity-driven producers of research that ``speaks for itself''. Rather, they are strategists with a keen awareness of the applied nature of public health who have moved beyond a scientific modus operandi towards a more contemporary research paradigm''

``Linear, rational depictions of the `the policy cycle' are increasingly viewed as idealised normative models that poorly describe a far messier social process (Greenhalgh, 2006, Hanney et al., 2003, Lewis, 2006).''

``The literature focuses on three broad issues: 
- the nature of the research (e.g., relevance, utility, timeliness), 
- the way that it is presented or disseminated (e.g., accessibility, narrative pull, producer-push activities) and 
- the communicative relationship between policymakers and researchers as they struggle to bridge the their `different worlds' Caplan, 1979;Innvaer et al., 2002];Lomas, 2000''

intersting findings include:
- different archetypes of researcher: traditional versus contemporary
- intersection with policy and how this was achieved
- intersection with other worlds, particularly media [curiously in CAN this would be industry, citizenry]
- strongly different opinions on the role of advocacy
- emphasis on relationships between researchers and policymakers},

This paper emphasises the importance of a people-centred approach for policy makers to achieve net zero effectively and rapidly while being alert to citizens’ needs and concerns. We advocate a comprehensive and inclusive public engagement strategy, discussing insights on four key questions to guide policymakers in developing successful engagement strategies. (1) How do climate-friendly social transformations happen?, (2) How can behavioural change for net zero be supported? (3) How can people be involved in decision-making on net zero?, and (4) How does climate change intersect with other societal challenges? We conclude with clear policy recommendations: government leadership at all levels (national, devolved, local), underpinned by a public engagement strategy for net zero, is needed in addition to fair and consistent policies that are transparent about the scale of action needed.},

In a global experiment conducted in 60 countries (N=51,224), we assess the differential impact of eleven climate interventions across the ideological divide. At baseline, we find political polarization of climate change beliefs and policy support globally, with people who reported being liberal believing and supporting climate policy more than those who reported being conservative (Cohen’s d=0.35 and 0.27, respectively). However, we find no evidence for a statistically significant difference between these groups in their engagement in a behavioral tree planting task. This conceptual-behavioral polarization incongruence results from self-identified conservatives acting despite not believing, rather than self-identified liberals not acting on their beliefs. We also find three interventions (emphasizing effective collective actions, writing a letter to a future generation member, and writing a letter from the future self) boost climate beliefs and policy support across the ideological spectrum, and one intervention (emphasizing scientific consensus) stimulates the climate action of people identifying as liberal. None of the interventions tested show evidence for a statistically significant boost in climate action for self-identified conservatives. We discuss implications for practitioners deploying targeted climate interventions.},

``In this updated systematic map which takes a snapshot of the literature between 2012-22, the importance of 
- accessible and available relevant evidence remains clear as the most reported factor. The 
- language used to describe useful evidence also seems to have shifted, with studies now often using phrases such as ‘actionable knowledge’  (Brunet et al., 2018, Gerber Leah et al., 2020, Project, 2021, Nguyen Vivian et al., 2019) rather than ‘evidence’ which may indicate a shift towards more applied and epistemologically inclusive research. There also seems to be a 
- growth of studies looking at ‘engaged’ research and scholarship (McIsaac and Riley, 2020, Patel, 2018, Springs et al., 2019) where researchers themselves participate in stakeholders’ processes and activities, rather than requiring stakeholders to get involved with research. This responds to calls for greater reflection by researchers, and to recognise that much of the evidence-policy ‘gap’ can be attributed to problems within academia, rather than to stakeholders’ failure to engage with research (Shaw, 2018, Crossgrove et al., 2019, Corluka et al., 2014).},

8. reflect continuously: should you engage, do you want to, and is it working?

But underlying these are different meanings between ``how to'' advice, empirical evidence, and policy studies

``These misunderstandings matter, because well-meaning people are giving recommendations that are not based on empirical evidence, and may lead to significant risks, such as reputational damage and wasted resources. Further, their audience may reinforce this problem by holding onto deficit models of science and policy, and equating policy impact with a simple linear policy cycle. When unsuccessful, despite taking the ‘how to’ advice to heart, researchers may blame politics and policymakers rather than reflecting on their own role in a process they do not understand fully.''

3 dilemmas:
- Should academics try to influence policy?
  - The public duty to engage versus the need to protect science
  - The potential for conflict and reputational damage
  - The need to represent academics and academia
- How should academics influence policy?
  - use specific tools such as evidence syntheses, or social media, to improve engagement
  - use emotional appeals and storytelling to craft attractive narratives with the explicit aim of shaping policy options
  - to collaborate
- What is the purpose of academics engagement in policymaking?
  - don't be tokenistic

Find some ``more thoughtful approaches which recognise more complex aspects of the task of influencing policy: 
- the emotional, practical and cognitive labour of engaging; that it often goes unrewarded by employers; 
- that impact is never certain, so engagement may remain unrewarded; and,
- that our current advice, structures and incentives have important implications for how we think about the roles and responsibilities of scientists when engaging with publics''},

  abstract         = {What makes knowledge relevant to environmental sustainability actionable, and how can its societal impacts be evaluated? Scholars and practitioners have increasingly advocated that the traditional linear model of knowledge production, with its unidirectional flow of information from researchers to policy-makers, be replaced by a new approach in which researchers and knowledge-users meaningfully interact to co-create knowledge that is actionable in decision-making. This popular model — co-production — has advanced thinking on how to create usable knowledge. In practice, however, co-production has not been a single approach, but instead a diversity of forms of engaged research. Further, the jargon may both obfuscate governance dimensions and limit understanding of what works. Improved distinction among the different ways researchers and societal partners interact can enable attentive and effective engagement across contexts. Recognition of this diversity is necessary in advancing the processes and impacts of actionable knowledge for sustainability.},
  comment          = {Co-product - jargon - may obfuscate the different governance dimensions and limit understanding of what works

Provide a framework of engaged research with 3 dimensions: contractual research and consulting <-> collaborative research (e.g. action research to co-production):
- origin of research question: researchers <-> stakeholdrers
- type of relationship: provision of services and resources <-> partnerships
- interacton over time: specific stages <-> continuous

And suggest principles-focused evaluation:
1. substantive interations
2. equitable relationships

Conclude with:

  * seek to invoke science early on in the framing process
  * avoid an approach that simply 'follows the science'
  * promote transparency in how evidence is used
  * acknowledge uncertainty and ambiguity
  * protect and sustain scientific integrity and independence

I review recent scholarship and argue that the next generation of research on the GBM should focus on better justifying the inclusion of moderators on both a theoretical and empirical level, explicitly manipulate motivations to process the consensus message, model how consensus cues operate in competitive information networks and test the model in field settings using causal chain experiments.},

``single definitive representations of science that are most vulnerable to political manipulation. Plural, conditional approaches are not immune, but they can help make political pressures more visible''

- translation - strategies that make research more accessible to practitioner users
- systemic change - institutional constraints that can pull producers and users in opposite directions despite their best intentions
- co-production - blurs the distinction between producer and user to produce knowledge that is of value to both

from the study, authors recommend academics engage by:
- learning how to better translate academic research to reflect the types and forms of knowledge that different parliamentary actors prefer
- build relationships with parliamentarians (shared understanding, trust), but this is not enough so they make a ``distinctive argument'' for
- sustained engagement through co-production

I look at the intersections between science and policy to highlight that science and policy, far from being mutually exclusive and hermetic categories, are intersecting domains of human activity which are in co-evolution. Science–policy interfaces are defined as social processes which encompass relations between scientists and other actors in the policy process, and which allow for exchanges, co-evolution, and joint construction of knowledge with the aim of enriching decision-making. They are implemented to manage the intersection between science and policy. The theoretical questions which arise at this intersection are then explored, which allows for the identification of a series of 15 normative requirements for science–policy interfaces. The conclusion suggests that this normative content may provide guidance for the design, implementation, and evaluation of real-life science–policy interfaces, and identifies key methodological issues which need further theoretical research as well as practical experimentation.},

identifies 15 normative requirements for science–policy interfaces

four domains of intersection stem from the institutionalisation of science and of its methods:
1. the processes of science stems from the fact that the processes of selecting, framing and addressing a scientific problem as well as the design of potential solutions pertain to both the scientific and the political processes.
2. the processes of science exists in the policy area that deals with scientific orientation and funding
3. quality and validation institutions of science - the very process of scientific validation of issue-driven science belongs both to the scientific process and to the policy process
4. scientific education and training},

Phases in the standard advisory process (has whole sections on these):
1. Framing the question p18
2. Selecting the advisors - involving the right advisers and avoiding conflicts of interest, ensuring the idependence of scientific advisers p19-20
3. Producing the advice - accommodating diverse opinions, managing uncertainty, quality assurance p20-21
4. Communicating and using the advice p21-23

This paper presents a checklist for advisory process: p41
1. Have a clear remit
2. Involve the relevant actors
3. Produce advice that is sound, unbiased and legitimate

Also considers the specific nature of science advice crisis situations
