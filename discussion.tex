\chapter{Discussion}\label{ch:discussion}

Should scientists be involved at the interface?
Clearly desire for decision makers to speak to experts given the range opportunities highlighted in this short study. There is perhaps little to [beat] the  authority and credibility of knowledge gained directly from scientists who are deeply immersed in their topic. Further, a number of participants expressed their enjoyment in the engagement, and their desire to do more. Thus there is a good justification for drawing together knowledge from scientists about how to best perform in this undertaking.

\section{behaviours, strategies and roles}
To effectively communicate knowledge into policy appears to require a great deal of effort, as as \textcite{BednarekSHG2015} demonstrate, this may be too much for any single scientist without the support of a dedicated knowledge brokerage organisation. ``connecting science and policy is not a part-time, `do it yourself' enterprise, but instead benefits from the skills and experience of practitioners who are immersed in the process''

If scientists are PE what does this mean for the objectivity of science?
If they are not, what does this mean when science knowledge is up against the influences of PEs?

However, frustrations were expressed by scientists that they didn't know if their efforts had any impact. One scientist even commented ``they already know all of this, I don't know what more we can tell them''. There is a psychological safety issue here, perhaps reflected in the comments of another about thinking they should perhaps had turned to activism. We should be concerned that some scientists - people who daily have to face the harsh realities of CAN science - experience the interface with policy [so brutally].

It may not be appropriate for scientists to be advocating directly, but their organisations should be advocating much more on their behalves.

Psychology finds that building the trust of citizens in decision making during peace time leads to a more effective response to a crisis \cite{BollykyP2024}. One participant, a [behavior scientist], observed that what is true for citizens' behaviours is just as true for policymakers. Thus, it would be reasonable for science and scientists to build and maintain the trust of policymakers ... CRELE ... As another observed, whilst lobbyists may have politically convenient... \unsure{p9}.... it is a long game.

\section{influence}
influence is difficult because
- \emph{} science is nuanced and complex
- \emph{topic} policymakers only interested in evidence that pertains to their current, often very specific, focus
- \emph{timing} windows of opportunity open and close quickly

\section{experiences and observations}
\subsection{decision levels}
many authors would talk about ``levels of policy'' without [implication]. Some described specifically how they would engage more readily and successfully at a more local level ... one described in some depth the relationship (or lack of) between these levels in particular policy settings. They described how they'd been involved in policy at an international level and then later seen the consequences of international decision making in the field p11 double disconnect, street level bureaucrats

\subsection{speak when you're spoken to}
Advice to perfectly hone advice to meet the existing needs P9 and interests of policymakers against the inability to speak truth to power P11

\subsection{stay on topic}
Importance of staying on topic ... but also constrains the possibility of influencing with new perspectives and insights [Luke's Non-decision-making power]

\subsection{citizen engagement}
citizens as stakeholders and subjects of CAN policy decisions we're mentioned.... The adverse impacts of [the waterfall of policy] at the community level were described in detail by one p11 ... for this reason, others expressed a belief that people should be involved in changes that will affect them (such as through CAs) p3  p1 aware of impact of their technologies on people, and considering researching how to address this, as well as being very open and keen to demonstrate to anyone who is willing to ask

\section{case classifications}
\subsection{types of science}
Differences between physical, technology and social science contexts?
Considering WesselinkH2020 typology of problems, at first glance climate change appears to be moderately structured since much of the knowledge now has a high certainty. However, it is in the solutions that the science becomes uncertain. Technology claims with confidence that is contested [refs to comparisons on NET and GGR papers laying out uncertainty of these]. The social science, in terms of the responses of individuals and society to impacts of the CAN crisis and to policies addressing it, is very uncertain. This is less likely to be expressed with certainty and does this thus explain the lower engagement of social scientists with policymaking?

Knowledge that is digestible policy - but also knowledge that is needed by policy. One of the major bottlenecks is surely around society and behaviour - these are the questions that still need answering. Therefore, presenting knowledge on social and behavioural consequences of current and potential policy. Such as what messages are out current emphasis of technological solutions (EVs, CSS, SAFs) implying for individuals and organisations.

\section{systemic issues}
\subsection{the science system}
\cite{Bendell2024} most scientists are limited by their own privilege, institutional contexts, and position ``within the system'', and thus fail to advocate for the changes that are required for truly just transition  
\cite{StoddardEtAl2021} problems arise due to powerful interests and resulting institutions leading to a pervasive failure to [question many of the core tenets of modern, industrialised societies]. Whether or not this is true, the influence of vested interests, alongside lack of political will, it is given by climate scientists as the main reasons for inadequate action on climate change \cite{Carrington2024} 
\cite{TurnhoutMWKL2020} - power and politics in shaping processes and outcomes

Scientists in more privileged fields should consider advocating for those in less privileged fields. This is analogous to advocacy in other contexts - the knowledge of those who tend to be marginalised by the current system is essential to [overthrow] that system.

This is a wider unspoken matter here. Whilst social identity was not part of this study, it was plain that [the majority/all] of the scientists who participated presented as racially white. Whilst this may be a artefact of the selection process (as previously stated, I used REF and online reports of scientists engaging with policymakers, followed by snowball identification of further participants)... privileges that lead to this role ... also play in policy. The significance here returns to the point about the bottlenecks in CAN science policy, which are largely societal. Therefore, why is society not represented at the interface tasked with overcoming these issues? [science and policy needs to take a long hard look at itself]. Where science may feel unheard, this is nothing to how the experience of others is ignored \cite{IbarraJOBCIMRS2022}. Issue of representation and power in who decides what is researched and how it is applied \cite{McNiePS2017}.

Why are scientists invited to present their knowledge to policymakers? Are scientists presenting knowledge that is not already available to them? How much do they act on the knowledge? How much more knowledge is required before policy catches up with the science?

I'm sure the scientists who expressed frustrations would agree that these frustrations are relative, and as nothing to the frustrations of scientists in less privileged settings or indeed policymakers constrained by [lack of fiscal flexibility e.g. subservient to dollar]

Being more readily rewarded by the process, rather than seeking an outcome, may feel more successful (p8 v p3). In complex issues, outcomes are unpredictable and emergent (maybe \cite{SnowdenB2007} and it is well know that it is difficult to trace input to outcomes \cite{BednarekSHG2015, perhaps something in the public participation literature on this e.g. \cite{Sprain2016}) and so 

Those who are less concerned about standard academic measures of success such as publications and REF impact case studies are possibly able to draw on other means of demonstrating success - those working in technology for instance are able to demonstrate prototypes p1

\information{gap is not just in policy, for CAN it is also between research and education \cite{DykeM2024} ... gap between the ``production and use of scientific information'' (Kirchhoff et al., 2013, p. 407; see Sarewitz and Pielke, 2007) \cite{McNiePS2017}}

\section{Academic impact on policy}
One of the main means of incentivising and rewarding the engagement of academia with [public decision making] has been to include policy impact in the REF, particularly the most recent REF [ref]. [very short summary of how impact case studies are selected by institutions]. An observation that came up several times was that the work that the participants had been involved in was selected for inclusion in their institution's REF submissions but they had never designed the work to have such an outcome. Moreover, there was [often/always] [an expression of surprise] that their work had ended up in the direction of impacting policy. For instance, In one case the work was actually designed to inform citizens. 

REF ``builds largely on linear models of the policy process'' \cite{CairneyO2020}

The serendipity and chance nature of policy engagement means that the highest impact research may never be designed to have such impact. And yet the nature of incentivisations such as REF and [UKRI paths to impact] may result in rather naive attempts to impact policy which could be a distraction and hindrance rather than a benefit. [More scientists sending their outputs into policy individually] [needs to be coordinated?]

\section{what works}
There are some activities that seem to be more successful, at least the few participants who were using those strategies seemed to rate highly their value. 

It is tempting to dismiss the myriad other strategies that scientists mentioned in the course of this research - e.g.s - which had inconclusive outcomes. However, it is also possible that the diversity of strategies has been valuable, creating a range of events, venues and media through which the richness of the science is conveyed. Whilst the more targetted strategies ultimately show signs of [hitting home], this may be due to these previous ``pre-softening'' activities (\cite{Cairney2018}).

but as \textcite{CairneyO2020} observe, success has more to do with context and entrepreneurship

\section{limitations}
time and resource constraints. other studies, e.g. \cite{HaynesDCRHGS2011,OjanenBKP2021} have more researchers and thus possibility to confer over coding as well as time for more and longer in depth interviews

Useful approach to selection influential scientists used by \textcite{HaynesDCRHGS2011} by nomination - not enough time to do this in the present study but [would perhaps create proxy for trying to determine what is success]

\section{Recommendations}\improvement{Maybe this should be a chapter}
One scientist mentioned that high turnover of policymakers, that some scientists may be frustrated by having to convey the same information repeatedly. Perhaps there's a level of knowledge that needs to be conveyed more widely, to account for current and future policymakers as well as those whom they represent and would hold them to account. Civic education and education to political science etc students (\cite{DykeM2024}) 

creating communities that bring together different scientific perspectives ... even other disciplines, multidisciplinarity, which aligns with Gibbons et al's Mode 2 knowledge production, perhaps also wider perspectives, post-normal science \cite{FuntowiczR1993}, extended peer communities, \cite{Jasanoff2003} recommending and advocating for? Transdisciplinarity even (\textcite{RussellWC2008} discusses constraints that current institutions create)

reframe the science-policy interface - this looks good: \url{https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020EF001628}

be prepared for interactions - e.g. elevator pitch: \url{https://academic.oup.com/aesa/article/112/2/75/5363856?login=true}

patient science - good quality science is essential for policy and can take a long time to accumulate - requires long term investment (no expectation of returning quick impact). This may be difficult with [highly specified funding requirements]

\subsection{to institutions}
incentives are not fully there for frank policy engagement - e.g. \cite{ElsensohnACDGGKPRS2019} ``biases and limitations at scientific institutions, including but not limited to, a lack of incentive structures, institutional guidelines, and employment limitations'' - example of programme of training in science advice, maybe advocacy \cite{RussellWC2008}
