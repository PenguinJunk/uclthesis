\begin{impactstatement}

	UCL theses now have to include an impact statement. \textit{(I think for REF reasons?)} The following text is the description from the guide linked from the formatting and submission website of what that involves. (Link to the guide: {\scriptsize \url{http://www.grad.ucl.ac.uk/essinfo/docs/Impact-Statement-Guidance-Notes-for-Research-Students-and-Supervisors.pdf}})

\begin{quote}
The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis,
discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits both
inside and outside academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

The benefits inside academia could be to the discipline and future scholarship, research methods or
methodology, the curriculum; they might be within your research area and potentially within other
research areas.

The benefits outside academia could occur to commercial activity, social enterprise, professional
practice, clinical use, public health, public policy design, public service delivery, laws, public
discourse, culture, the quality of the environment or quality of life.

The impact could occur locally, regionally, nationally or internationally, to individuals, communities or
organisations and could be immediate or occur incrementally, in the context of a broader field of
research, over many years, decades or longer.

Impact could be brought about through disseminating outputs (either in scholarly journals or
elsewhere such as specialist or mainstream media), education, public engagement, translational
research, commercial and social enterprise activity, engaging with public policy makers and public
service delivery practitioners, influencing ministers, collaborating with academics and non-academics
etc.

Further information including a searchable list of hundreds of examples of UCL impact outside of
academia please see \url{https://www.ucl.ac.uk/impact/}. For thousands more examples, please see

\begin{acknowledgements}
I have been humbled by the willingness of participants to share their experiences and wealth of insights for this study. I have learned a great deal more than I ever anticipated and it is wonderful to know that so much expertise, energy and commitment is being devoted to climate and nature science and policy. 

To Alice Cowell and Dean Bennett for your regular, no-obligation, check-ins -- thank you for keeping me connected to the world.

Thank you to the 2+ cohorts of IIPP MPA students who have taught me so much about their worlds -- it has been the greatest of privileges -- and to the MPA ``part-timers'', especially Holly, Cath, Alex, Jaspal and Catherine, who eased my long commutes with accommodation and easy company.

Thank you also to the students and staff at ECS, University of Southampton, for welcoming me into the lab, especially Prof. Jon Hare for suggesting I complete this thesis there, it has been a huge blessing. %and TimBL's pianola for being silent company during each interview.

Most importantly, the biggest thank you to my family, Gary Llewellyn, Rowan Sargent Llewellyn and Spoon for tolerating my deep focus and deeper tiredness and showing their understanding in chocolate, shoulder-rubs and washing up.
