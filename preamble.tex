\begin{abstract} % 300 word limit
My research is about stuff.

It begins with a study of some stuff, and then some other stuff and things.

There is a 300-word limit on your abstract.

\begin{impactstatement}

	UCL theses now have to include an impact statement. \textit{(I think for REF reasons?)} The following text is the description from the guide linked from the formatting and submission website of what that involves. (Link to the guide: {\scriptsize \url{http://www.grad.ucl.ac.uk/essinfo/docs/Impact-Statement-Guidance-Notes-for-Research-Students-and-Supervisors.pdf}})

\begin{quote}
The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis,
discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits both
inside and outside academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

The benefits inside academia could be to the discipline and future scholarship, research methods or
methodology, the curriculum; they might be within your research area and potentially within other
research areas.

The benefits outside academia could occur to commercial activity, social enterprise, professional
practice, clinical use, public health, public policy design, public service delivery, laws, public
discourse, culture, the quality of the environment or quality of life.

The impact could occur locally, regionally, nationally or internationally, to individuals, communities or
organisations and could be immediate or occur incrementally, in the context of a broader field of
research, over many years, decades or longer.

Impact could be brought about through disseminating outputs (either in scholarly journals or
elsewhere such as specialist or mainstream media), education, public engagement, translational
research, commercial and social enterprise activity, engaging with public policy makers and public
service delivery practitioners, influencing ministers, collaborating with academics and non-academics
etc.

academia please see \url{https://www.ucl.ac.uk/impact/}. For thousands more examples, please see

\begin{acknowledgements}
%I have been humbled by the willingness of participants to share their experiences and wealth of insights for this study. I have learned a great deal more than I could ever anticipate. To know that such expertise, energy and commitment is being applied  I am also grateful for the work that they, and so many other scientists are doing to provide climate and nature policy  to the participants of this study who gave me time and a great wealth of insight and experience. ... I also found a gained a great deal of confidence that the communication of policy was in such capable hands. 

Students and staff at ECS, UoS for welcoming me into the lab, especially Prof Jon Hare for suggesting it, and TimBL's pianola for being silent company during each interview
