  comment          = {Discusses reason, its purpose and evolution and how it manifests in human societies. Find that it is a ``tool to convince others and not less importantly a tool for evaluating the arguments others produce to convince us'': p331-332. Reason has evolved to benefit individuals - either by convincing and influencing others and also by evaluating the justifications and arguments given by others: p333. However, much like other evolved features can manifest outside of this proper *domain*, manifesting in the *actual* domain. ``The proper domain of reasoning is disagreements between oneself and others - clashes of ideas...The actual domain of reasoning, the kind of input that triggers its operations, is. we have argued, the detection of a clash of ideas'': p289-290.  

Reason has been the focus of philosophy and psychology for millennia. Most works argues that reason has an intellectual purpose - to weigh up justifications and produced good, unbiased decisions making. However, the evidence from studies is that reasoning is ``biased - people overwhelmingly find reasons that support their previous beliefs - and it is lazy - people do not carefully scrutinize their own reasons'': p247. When people make choices based on reasons, the results can be worse than using intuition p216-218 ``when people have weak or conflicting intuitions, reason drives them towards the decision for which it is easiest to find reason - the decisions that they can best justify'': p255. 

Starts with introduction of representations and of modules that enable cognition and reasoning. ``Representations are material things, such as activation of groups of neurons in a brain, magnetic patterns in an electronic storage medium, or ink patterns in a piece of paper. They can be inside an organism or in its environment. What makes such a material thing a representation is not its location, its shape, or its structure it is its function. A representation has the function of providing an organisation (or, more generally, any information-processing device) with information about some state of affairs'' p81 

''Metarepresentational modules provide information not only about the representations metarepresented but also, indirectly, these modules have very specific domains, namely, specific aspects of specific kinds of representations... `` p 104  

''The main role of reasons is not to motivate or guide us in reaching conclusions but to explain and justify after the fact the conclusions we have reached'' p112 ``[a review of] a rich range of evidence showing that we have little or no introspective access to our own mental processes and that our verbal reports of these processes are often confabulations'' p114-115 

Inference is deeply linked to reason, in fact reason cannot be achieved without inference at some level - all reasons are inferred, or the reason for these reasons are inferred: p132. ``One of the main claims of this book is that reasoning is not an alternative to intuitive inference; reasoning is use of intuitive inferences about reasons'': p133. ``We infer what our reasons much have been from the conclusions we intuitively arrived at'': p141. 

There have been many different views of reasoning, including probabilistic - and more specifically Bayesian - form of thinking (Oaksford and Chater): p165. Discusses the purpose of reason from an evolutionary perspective. Whilst ancient philosophers would see reason as distinguishing humans from animals, ``The functional effects of reason are roughly the same for Darwin as they were for Aristotle. What is new with Darwin, however, is the use of the effects to explain why reason should have evolved'': p179.  

There's quite a bit of discussion of this including those who believe that reason is a flawed feature. But the book draws the conclusion that ``Reason fulfils two main functions. One function helps solve a major problem of coordination by producing justifications. The other function helps solve a major problem of communication by producing arguments'' (argumentative theory of reasoning): p183. ``The ability to produce and evaluate reasons has not evolved in order to improve psychological insight but as a tool for defending or criticising thoughts and actions, for expressing commitments and for creating mutual expectations. The main function of attributing reasons is to justify oneself and to evaluate the justification of others'': p186. 

The development of idea of the lone reasoner has ``obscured the degree to which reasoning (including scientific reasoning) is a social activity, and the degree to which it is based on intuitions'': p198. 

From studies ``intuitions aimed at gathering the most useful information while reasoning aimed at confirming the participants' stereotypes'': p218. However, this is not so much confirmation bias as ``myside bias''. ``people have no general preference for confirmation. What they find difficult is not looking for counterevidence or counterarguments in general, but only when what is being challenged is their own opinion'': p218. 

The interactionist view of reason explains that better reasons are obtained by argumentation. Weak justifications and arguments, which require less energy to come by, are soon rejected by both sides and the arguers develop better reasons to support their ideas (or their minds are changed) p228. This approach takes less effort and is much more effective than trying to obtain all the arguments alone. Also, people are not good at evaluating the value of their own reasons. However, ``The fact that people are good at evaluating others; reasons is the nail in the coffin of the intellectualist approach. It means that people have the ability to reason objectively, rejecting weak arguments and accepting strong ones but that they do not use these skills on the reasons they produce'': p235. Being biased and lazy, spells disaster for the lone reasoner ... lead to extreme positions'': p247. 

However, ``groups can have disappointing performance not only when pooling physical force but also in a variety of cognitive problems. Brainstorming is a typical example. By and large, group brainstorming doesn't work. In a typical brainstorming session, participants are told not to voice their criticisms, so that they feel free to suggest even wild ideas. This doesn't work: a brainstorming group typically generates fewer and worse ideas then if the ideas of each individual working in isolation had been gathered. By contrast, telling people that 'most studies suggest that you should debate and even criticise each other's ideas' allows them ot produce more ideas'': p266.  

Groups work best when debate is permitted even difficult problems such as predicting geopolitics - groups in which individuals saw the average of their peer's predictions worked better than those who made predictions alone, but those who were allowed to debate rather than just see an average were better still: p270. 

There is even evidence that children who are reasoned with, rather than persuaded using authority, have better outcomes (this could be correlation and not necessarily causation): p291. Also, students who spent time in debate did better than those spending equivalent time essay-writing, even though their writing style was poorer: p298. Also, good evidence that involving citizens in debates about issues that matter results in people who are not only ``better informed and more articulate, but also have a deeper understanding of other people's point of view'': p309-310 [citizens assemblies] (Fishkin 2009, Landemore 2013, Mercier and Landemore 2012). 

Reasoning on the abolition of slavery is given special scrutiny, noting that the anti-abolitionists strongest arguments weren't moral but economic [as with today's anti-environment arguments]. 

The good and the bad of reasoning even applies to scientists, who will find arguments to explain away weak results p318 but will also change their minds when presented with good arguments p319. Looking at so-called solitary geniuses reveals that they were far from solitary and developed their ideas in collaboration with others either by direct discussion or correspondence or by reading their work p322.},

  comment          = {''Addressing ethical issues systematically requires resource and time, familiarity with assessment/audit regimes and the ability to use the outputs of these tools to make judgements''

AI concerns are
- epistemic - the probabilistic nature of insights, the inherent inscrutability of `black box' algorithms, and the fallibility of the data used for training and input
- normative - fairness of decisional outcomes, erosion of informational privacy, and increasing surveillance and profling of individuals

Phases of AI ethics
 - 2016 to 2019 - high-level ethical principles for AI published such as catalogues of ethical principles and frameworks for ethical, trustworthy responsible AI. These might best address the impacts of AI and data-driven systems framed as applied ethics. Dominated by a philosophical approach as opposed to legal or technical approach.
- A second phase saw a more technical approach from the computer science community. Focus on fairness, accountability and transparency, `ethical-by-design'
- current phase is a move `from what to how', proposals for governance mechanisms, regulation, impact assessment, auditing tools and standards leading to the ability to assure and ultimately, insure AI systems
- latterly a shift towards acknowledgement of political, social and justice issues `beyond the principled and the technical, to practical mechanisms for rectifying power imbalances'

This paper uses audit and assurance practises from other sectors, like financial services, to identify gaps in current ethical impact assessment and audit practises.

''Risks in AI can manifest as either underusing the technology and missing out on value creation and innovation, or overusing/misusing the technology''

First identified 169 ethics documents.
Reduced these to only those ``that s that would give an organisation or practitioner a concrete tool to apply to AI production or deployment'' resulting in a set of 39 documents.

Created some useful typologies:
- stakeholder types
- tool types for impact assessment
- tool types for audits
- processes that were inspected internally vs those that allowed for external inspection
- technical design tools (workshop materials, documentation or technical tools)
- when tool used and if applied to data and/or model

Key fndings:
- The focus has moved from data to models from 2017 to 2020
- Stakeholder types using the tools are limited to those closely related to doing the work
- There is little participation in the assessment or audit process by certain stakeholder groups 
- Only one tool requires external assessment (IEEE)
- Techniques and practices deployed by other forms of Impact Assessment (like EIAs) are not present or rarely suggested in ethical AI impact assessments
- Checklists/questionnaires are ubiquitous across Impact Assessment tools

  abstract         = {Urbanization is the second largest mega-trend right after climate change. Accurate measurements of urban morphological and demographic figures are at the core of many international endeavors to address issues of urbanization, such as the United Nations' call for “Sustainable Cities and Communities”. In many countries - particularly developing countries -, however, this database does not yet exist. Here, we demonstrate a novel deep learning and big data analytics approach to fuse freely available global radar and multi-spectral satellite data, acquired by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Via this approach, we created the first-ever global and quality controlled urban local climate zones classification covering all cities across the globe with a population greater than 300,000 and made it available to the community (https://doi.org/10.14459/2021mp1633461). Statistical analysis of the data quantifies a global inequality problem: approximately 40\% of the area defined as compact or light/large low-rise accommodates about 60\% of the total population, whereas approximately 30\% of the area defined as sparsely built accommodates only about 10\% of the total population. Beyond, patterns of urban morphology were discovered from the global classification map, confirming a morphologic relationship to the geographical region and related cultural heritage. We expect the open access of our dataset to encourage research on the global change process of urbanization, as a multidisciplinary crowd of researchers will use this baseline for spatial perspective in their work. In addition, it can serve as a unique dataset for stakeholders such as the United Nations to improve their spatial assessments of urbanization.},
  comment          = {Perform ``urban local climate zones classification'' (LCZ) on Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 data using deep CNN.

The So2Sat LCZ42 benchmark dataset has 17 classes describing largely the building character (compact high-rise, open mid-rise, lightweight low-raise (favela?), etc plus non urban - dense trees, bare rock/paved, etc) labelled manually - with rigorous QA - for 42 urban agglomerations and other areas.

Model is two residual CNNs, one for sentinel-2 input including up to 4 seasons and the other for sentinel-1, 1 season input. Each CNNs produces a 17 vector preduction for which the mean across the predictions is input to the softmax.

Evidence is that sentinel-1 adds very little (but something) to classification. Probably would be better if it were higher spatial resolution.

Assessment is performed using 3 different splits of the data:
random-split - the data were split into train-test using random function across all examples - this would be the upper bound of achievable classification accuracy - this would give a representative measure of accuracy for unseen cities whose data distribution is similar to the training cities
block-split - urban agglomerations were split into non-overlapping train-test areas
held-out cultural-10 split - some agglomerations were entirely withheld - this would be the lower bound of the achievable accuracy by evaluating completely held-out data in a cross-validation scheme

Urban morphology is analysed by viewing the classified images for different urban regions.

Found very different proportions of people live in different population densities: ``60\% of the population live in compact and lightweight/large low-rise areas, occupying 40\% of the built up area. Another 35\% of the population lives in open or sparsely built areas, occupying 55\% of the areas. The remaining 5\% of the population is distributed in the non-built-up LCZ classes. This huge difference in population density reflects a possible inequality in living conditions''.

A clustering is performed on cities based on the quantity and spatial location of LCZs across all cities and identify some characteristics patterns which given the following labels:
European Cities
Cities of the Islamic world
Predominantly Chinese cities
Predominantly African cities
European-African-Asian cities
Very large cities

They do talk a bit about urban heat islands and the climatic impact of urban areas but I don't really understand why these particular classes are referred to as local climate zones.},

  abstract         = {The classification of land use and land cover (LULC) is a well-studied task within the domain of remote sensing and geographic information science. It traditionally relies on remotely sensed imagery and therefore models land cover classes with respect to their electromagnetic reflectances, aggregated in pixels. This paper introduces a methodology which enables the inclusion of geographical object semantics (from vector data) into the LULC classification procedure. As such, information on the types of geographic objects (e.g., Shop, Church, Peak, etc.) can improve LULC classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate how semantics can be fused with imagery to classify LULC. Three experiments were performed to explore and highlight the impact and potential of semantics for this task. In each experiment CORINE LULC data was used as a ground truth and predicted using imagery from Sentinel-2 and semantics from LinkedGeoData using deep learning. Our results reveal that LULC can be classified from semantics only and that fusing semantics with imagery—Semantic Boosting—improved the classification with significantly higher LULC accuracies. The results show that some LULC classes are better predicted using only semantics, others with just imagery, and importantly much of the improvement was due to the ability to separate similar land use classes. A number of key considerations are discussed.},

Consider learning across domains that include:
ImageNet
CropDisease
EuroSAT
ISIC (medical imagery)
ChestX (x-rays)

Measure similarity of domains using criteria:
1) existence of perspective distortion
2) the semantic content
3) color depth

The datasets include agriculture images (natural images, but specific to agriculture industry), satellite (loses perspective distortion), dermatology (loses perspective distortion, and contains different semantic content), and radiological images (different according to all 3 criteria).

Evaluate several few-shot learning approaches:
- Meta-learning (e.g. MatchingNet and MAML for single-domain cases and Feature-wise transform and Adversarial Domain Adaptation with Reinforced Sample Selection in cross-domain cases) are approaches for which the aim of training is to learn how to learn a new task easily
- transfer learning, from a single model includes: fixed feature extractor, fine-tuning all layers, fine-tuning last-k layers, transductive fine-tuning
- Transfer from Multiple Pre-trained Models, includes methods to select the most useful features from a library of pre-trained models for each task

Best results are for IMS-f which is a method of transferring from multiple pre-trained models and involves fine-tuning each pretrained model before applying model selection. The other fine-tuning methods also work well. Fixed feature extractor works little better than a random embedding (and MatchingNet performs less well than random embedding). Results are better for those target domains that are more similar to the source domain.},

Label assignment is achieved using a modification of k-means to assign data to classes or clusters (based on learned representations). This modification ensures that those inputs with a known class are assigned to the same cluster but those without a label can be assigned to any cluster (based on distance from the centroid).

  comment          = {Demostrates masses of evidence that, once societies have reached a level of prosperity, it is not wealth that influences good outcomes (good health, low violence, ...) but the level of equality. Also, draws on other research to provide clear explanation of why this is.

After the first edition was published, there were a number of criticisms, each of which is addressed in a new chapter. At the end of this, comments on the rise of neo-liberal political and economic thinking which pushed out egalitarian ideas in the 1980 and 1990s. However, demonstrates how the content of The Spirit Level is now influencing politics: ``In a major speech a the end of 2009, David Cameron said The Spirit Level showed 'that among the richest countries, it's the more unequal ones that do worse according to almost every life indicator''. ``In September 2010 ... Ed Miliband said ' I do believe this country is too unequal and the gap between rich and poor doesn't just harm the poor, it harms us all'' p298

Uses the same set of the worlds richest countries, as well as US states, and looks at relationship between income inequality (there are many possible measures of inequality, but they don't make much difference p17) and an index of health and social problems, which combined:
- level of trust
- mental illness (inc drug and alcohol addiction)
- life expectancy and infant mortality
- obesity
- children's educational performance
- teenage births
- homicides
- imprisonment rates
- social mobility (not available for US states)
p19

Also, UNICEF index of child wellbeing (for which UK scores bottom out of this set of wealth countries)

Health and social problems occur in individuals and the book describes how it is the individual's response to the social inequality that is the cause. People always have a sense of their rank within society. Anxiety has been rising over time. So has self-esteem. However, there seem to be two groups of people with high self-esteem. One group has positive outcomes, but another ``showed tendencies to violence, racism, who were insensitive to others and were bad a personal relationships'' p37. This second group are the self-promoters p44. The rise in anxiety has been accompanied with rising narcissism, both having roots in 'social evaluative threat' p37. A study of experiments into effects of stress on individuals have found that the most consistent stressors are threats to self-esteem and social status p38. 

Later in the book, it links these responses to inequality with our genetic make up. Psychology/economics experiments show how people will choose to gain nothing rather than accept an unfair offer p202. Chimps and Bonobos are our genetically closest species and yet they have different social structures ``The chimpanzee resolves secual issues with power; the bonobo resolves power issues with sex''. In the section of DNA that regulates these characteristics, humans are closer to the bonobo p205. Humans are preoccupied by social interaction because this is of paramount importance p206. Mirror neurons trigger small muscle responses to what we see others do (and thus we can empathise) p213. Social exclusion results in the same response as physical pain p214.

Looks at the different health and social indicators, each of which has a strong relationship to inequality:

Level of trust - different Inequality also correlates levels of distrust, with resulting poor outcomes for communities. Probably distrust is an outcome of inequality but also this may lead to feedback that further decreases equality p62.

Mental illness - this is affected by our judgement of ourselves and how we believe others view us and levels of trust

Physical health and life expectancy - social status, social networks and stress in early childhood are the psychosocial factors in determining the health of a population, in wealthy countries p77 There is no relationship between the amount of spending on healthcare per person and life expectancy p81

Obesity - its not just about calories and the amount of exercise, stress also seems to cause the body to metabolise differently p95 ``The Thrifty Phenotype'', triggered by stressed conditions pre-birth, has lower metabolic rate p100

Educational performance - more family conflict and disruption in low-income families (due to the reasons above i.e. trust, health) can affect learning p111 but also children are acutely aware of social status and this directly affects outcomes p113

Teenage pregnancy - one factor is that parenthood is the way that young women join the adult world and gain a status, when educational outcomes are poorer

Violence - interestingly, in US states, the relationship between homicide rates and inequality was greater if the rate of gun owndership was factored in (i.e. access to a gun has a relationship to homicide rate too)

Imprisonment - more unequal societies have longer sentences but these do not deter people from crime p153. More equal societies tend to design their criminal justice systems with consultation from experts - criminalogists, lawyers, prison psychiatrists and psychologists p155. Media and political pressure have a greater influence in more unequal societies p156.

The different ways that countries achieve equality of income - scandinavian countries tend to redistribute using taxes and benefits whereas Japan  has a greater equality of market incomes but the health and social outcomes are the same p184

Social status and friendship are linked to health outcomes, strength of community life and violence. Social status and friendship are two opposite ways that humans come together - either by stratification with privileged access to resources, regardless of need or by reciprocity, mutuality, sharing, social obligations, co-operations and recognitions of each others' needs  p199-200

Inequality and the environment: Simple view of development demonstrates that above a certain level of CO2 emissions there is no improvement in life expectancy p219 A great deal of what drives consumption is status competition p226.

''It is often suggested that invention and innovation go with inequality and depend on the promise of individual financial incentives. However, Figure 15.3 suggests the contrary - that more equal societies ten to be more creative'' p225

consumption is a substitute for status, growth is a substitute for equality, more equality makes growth less necessary p226

The things that matter are health, happiness, friendship, community life. But cutting carbon emissions, limiting economic growth in rich countries, is not just having fewer luxuries, inequality has to be reduced simultaneously p231.

More equal societies more public spirited  p232

''to give ourselves the best chance of making the necessary transformation of society we need to remember that the aim is to make a more sociable society, which means avoiding the disruption and dislocation which increase insecurity and fear and so often end in a disastrous backlash'' p237.

''A study which analysed trends in inequality during the 1980s and 1990s ... found that the most important single factor was trade union membership'' p245.

''Although some profit-making businesses have high ethical standards, the institutional framework, seem to invite them to an exploitative relationship with society'' p254.

''To make a reliable difference to company performance, share-ownership has to be combined with more participative management methods'' p256

Inequality, a sense of unfairness and having less control at work has detrimental impact on health outcomes p256

''If Britain became as equal as [the average of Japan, Norway, Sweden and Finland], levels of trust might be expected to be two-thirds as high again as they are now, mental illness might be more than halved, everyone would get an addition year of life, teenage birth rates could fall to one-third of what they are now, homicide rates could fall by 75 per cent, everyone could get the equivalent of almost seven weeks extra holiday a year and the government could b closing prisons all over the country'' p268-269.},

Interesting and galvanising, with a lot of practical 'how to'.
The one aspect that I didn't quite follow was that it talk about long-run growth (e.g. p 164) without saying what that is or what happens when it ultimately ceases. 

Contents gives a lot away:

Capitalism is in crisis:
- Finance is financing FIRE (finance, insurance and real estate)
- Business is focussing on quarterly returns
- The planet is warming
- Governments are tinkering, not leading

Five myths that impeded progress:
- Businesses create value and take risks; governments only de-risk and facilitate
- The purpose of government is to fix market failures
- Government needs to un like a business
- Outsourcing saves taxpayer money and lowers risk
- Governments shouldn't pick winners

Lessons from Apollo
- Leadership: vision and purpose
- Innovation: risk-taking and experimentation
- Organisational change: agility and flexibility
- Spillovers: serendipity and collaboration
- Finance: outcomes-based budgeting
- Business and the state: partnership with a common purpose

Mission-oriented Policies on Earth
- Selecting a mission
- Implementing a mission
- Engaging citizens in a mission
- Mission: a Green New Deal
- Mission: innovating for accessible health
- Mission: narrowing the digital divide

Seven principles for a new political economy
- Value: collectively created
- Markets: shaping not fixing
- Organisations: dynamic capabilities
- Finance: outcomes-based budgeting
- Distribution: sharing risks and rewards
- Partnership: purpose and stakeholder value
- Participation: open systems to co-design our future

a mission-oriented approach ``means choosing directions for the economy and then putting the problems that need solving to get there at the centre of how we design our economic systems'' p8 (this seems analogous to me to the optimisation function alluded to in Stuart Russell's 4th Reith Lecture Russell2021d)

only about a fifth of finance goes into the productive economy p16

Much of current economic thinking is based on Market Failure Theory, which states that markets are the most efficient allocators of resources under three specific  conditions:
1. there is a complete set of markets
2. all consumers and producers behave competitively
3. equilibrium exists (e.g. supply exactly matches demand)
and the only role of government to correct for external positive or negative externalities or information asymmetries
In addition to this, Public Choice Theory, assumes that agents, including government agents, are also self-interested. This means that policy-making is subject to capture by interest groups (because collective action by voters tends to be weak and voters are not very interested) resulting in
- neopotism
- cronyism
- corruption
- rent-seeking
- misallocation of resources
- unfair and damaging competition (crowding out)
Therefore, the conditions that indicate a government should intervene need to outweigh losses of government failure.
Yet there is no empirical evidence for this, even though these theories are used to prevent government taking amitious steps.
p 31 - 33

New Public Management theory is used to justify government being run like a business such as by having cost-benefit analysis of any allocation of funding p25-37

This is why we should have research functions in public sector: ``The key role of NASA is to define the mission, plan the programme, be clear on the guidelines, set the parameters and then allow as much innovation as possible to create the product or service required. None of this could ave been done without the NASA staff themselves having experience of the underlying science and technology; In fact, it would have been impossible to choose contrator intelligently without that knowledge. Additionally, by developing internal expertise, contracts with the private sector would be better managed because those writing them would know just as much about the technology as the contractors'' p 95

``having a vision is not enough, it is essential to engage with citizens about it'' p109

The Sustainable Development Goals SDGs make good missions because they require work over many domains: social, political, technological, behavioural and feedback processes. They also are broken down in to 169 targets. p110

Often innovation policy is focussed on outcomes, such as support for a particular technology. Instead, focus should be on the problem to be solved - the technology and start-ups will follow p111

Describes how to build a mission-map
Grand challenge - what needs solving - e.g. climate change
Mission - what the solution looks like - e.g. 100 carbon neutral European cities by 2030
Sectors - the difficult sectors that needs to be engaged - e.g. real estate, energy, mobility, ...
Mission projects - breaking down the mission to components - e.g. building with carbon neutral components, clean urban electric mobility, ...
p112-114

Mazzucato advised UK Government on how to apply a mission-oriented approach, leading to 2017 Industrial Strategy: Building a Britain fit for the future p117

A mission needs to:
- be bold and inspirational, with societal relevance
- set goals for investment in innovation
- encourage mutltiple solutions
p121-124

Mission implementation requires:
- policy instruments that focus on outcomes and foster innovation
- new approach to governance to includes public finance as investor of first resort
- Appropriate indicators and monitoring frameworks
- A change in how private and public sectors work together
''It is not about government bringing in the private sector to show how public research leads to commercialisation. Most commercialisation opportunities from public research - such as development of the software industry following Appollo - occurred precisely when government kept its eye on the prize and did not worry about the economic value or commercialisation what would result''
p124-130

Citizens need to be engaged not just in the ideas but the design and assessment of the mission. This is collaborative participatory and may require frank debates. But it also must avoid the capture by vested interests. It may not be harmonious but it must represent all perspectives, not just those of the 'elite' experts. p132-137

``Mainstream economic prescriptions of simply solving climate change with a carbon tax and some R\&D subsidies (to let the markest find the optimal pathway), combined with political conomic impediments to carbon taxes, have left us with negligent carbon tax systems and a worryingly slow green transition'' p142

``As behavioural science has shown (and the rader knows from everyday life), real persons do not normally optimally react to price incentives, and they tend to 'satisfice' rather than maximise profits or measures of happiness at every step of the way'' p142

In mainstream economic approaches, the costs are socialised (government funds the research and shoulders the risk) while the profits are privatised (shareholders receive the rewards) p147

``Scientific and medical innovation thrives and progress is made when knowledge is exchanged openly, building upon shared successes and failures. But proprietary science does not follow that logic: it promote secretive competition, prioritises crossing regulatory finishing lines in wealthy countries over wide availability ... and erects barriers to technological diffusion'' p150

```Wicked' problems cannot be solved in a linear way, and there is no tech solution to social problems'' p154

BBC Computer Literacy Project as an example of a public-led mission (computer literacy) that resulted in spin-outs most notably ARM Holdings and Raspberry Pi p158

``The mission attitude is not about picking individual sectors to support but about identifying problems that can catalyse collaboration beween many different sectors'' p159

On outsourcing during Covid-19 pandemic: ``By relying on consultancy firms to manage the test-and-trace system, the government has not only deprived our brilliant civil servants of an opprtunity to demosntrate and develop their knowledge, but in doing so undermined the possiblity of organisation learning through the crisis'' p177

The 5 capabilities required by government organisations to manage complex and 'wicked' problems:
- Leadership and engagement
- Co-ordination
- Administration
- Risk-taking and experimentation
- Dynamic evaluation

In terms of finance, takes a good deal from The Deficit Myth p182-188

Regarding distribution, advises for predistribution, and only correcting using redistribution (taxes and benefits) p189 

``A stakeholder view needs instaed to reward all stakeholders, not only shareholders: workers, the communities and the environment. This concept recognises that value is collectively created...'' p194

Defending the underlying public interest can be in terms of the approach to the 'commons' - such as data commons'' - take from Elinor Omstrom here p197

Pass images through trained network for a single class and identify the parts of those images that are most salient to that class. Then, to determine meaningfulness:

''We asked 30 participants to perform two tasks: As a baseline test of meaningfulness, first we ask them to choose the more meaningful of two options. One being four segments of the same concept (along with the image they were segmented from) and the other being four random segments of images in the same class. the right option was chosen 95.6\% (14.3/15)(±1.0). To further query the meaningfulness of the concepts, participants were asked to describe their chosen option with one word. As a result, for each question, a set of words (e.g. bike, wheel, motorbike) are provided and we tally how many individuals use the same word to describe each set of image. F''},

  comment          = {I thought this was a really excellent paper that explored the impact of pretraining (the upstream task) to the accuracy of the downstream tasks. They performed a large empirical study looking at a range of different algorithms, datasets and downstream tasks they identify that there appears to be an upper limit of accuracy on the downstream (DS) task. Find upstream accuracy is not a predictor of downstream accuracy and that optimal parameters for the upstream task may be at odds with those for the downstream tasks. Specifically, it may be necessary to hurt the accuracy of the upstream model to gain better downstream results or to select the upstream model for the specific downstream tasks. This behaviour is closely related to the usefulness of representations in higher layers of the upstream model. Say that ``ultimately the problem is down to data diversity''and so I presume this means that the problem is that the downstream task is out-of-distribution.

Again this is relevant to our's work pretraining models and emphasises that striving for a highly accurate backbone model is probably unnecessary. Rather, it may be worth building multiple benchmark problems to test different backbones and transfer learning approach against will help us establish what are the best approaches to upstream and downstream training. 

From The Batch:

The authors re-examined 4,800 experiments performed on diverse architectures: Vision Transformers, MLP-Mixers, and ResNets. The models had been pretrained to classify labeled images in JFT or ImageNet 21K. They were tested on 25 tasks, including classifying objects, classifying the orientation of objects, and diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, after fine-tuning via few-shot learning or transfer learning. In few-shot learning, the last layer was replaced and trained on 25 examples. In transfer learning, the whole network was fine-tuned on 1,000 examples.

For each model and fine-tuned task, the authors plotted pretrained accuracy on the horizontal axis and fine-tuned accuracy on the vertical axis. The resulting swaths of clustered dots generally rose nonlinearly until they reached a plateau. 
The authors calculated a curve to match the best results in each task. Then they extended that line to extrapolate fine-tuned accuracy if pretrained accuracy were 100 percent.
In their own experiments, they varied the size of the pretraining set (JFT), number of parameters in the model (Vision Transformer), and number of epochs in pretraining. Then they repeated the steps above. 
Results: Higher pretrained accuracy generally yielded higher fine-tuned accuracy — but it reached a point of diminishing returns. In some cases, higher pretrained accuracy yielded worse fine-tuned accuracy. Moreover, pretrained models of equal accuracy didn't necessarily perform equally well on different fine-tuned tasks. The authors' own experiments matched the curves they derived from earlier work, leading them to conclude that dataset size, number of parameters in a model, and length of training don't significantly influence the relationship between pretrained and fine-tuned accuracy.

Why it matters: More pretraining doesn't necessarily result in a better fine-tuned model.

We're thinking: One limiting factor in the value of pretraining accuracy may be the relevance of the pretrained task to the fine-tuned task. No matter how well a model classifies ImageNet, it may not easily learn how to diagnose medical images. A rigorous framework for managing the tradeoff between pretraining and fine-tuning would be useful.},

There appears to be an upper limit of accuracy on the downstream (DS) task, over many models/data/downstream tasks/parameters for image recognition tasks Models - Transformer, MLP mixer and ResNet models Data - JFT, ImageNet21k Downstream tasks - VTAB, MetaDataset, Wilds and medical imaging Convex hull of all experiments shows saturation of performance of downstream tasks Model selection should be done for each DS task so several models with similar US accuracy have different impacts on DS accuracy Behaviour is captured in usefulness of representations in higher layers of US model Optimal hyperparameters for US task may be at odds with optimal hyperparameters for DS task Ultimately the problem is down to data diversity for downstream tasks I can't tell if pretraining using same data domain avoids some of this or not},

In many ways, there's logic in this because Semantic Segmentation using convolutions has had to overcome the problem that convolutions reduce the resolution of the output. However, convoutions address the limitations of dense predictors such as MLPs (and transformers) by reducing the number of learnable parameters and allowing flexibility in the input data size and spatial scale (because they don't need to learn a set of weights for each input pixel position). This method overcomes these limitations of MLP by performing some sort of cycling over the sampling space. I confess I couldn't really understand what they were doing and wonder if it will turn out to be analogous to passing a kernel across the data...},

By looking at how good trained DNNs are at classification given masked data they find that DNNs tend to be good at classifying using simple concepts and complex concepts, but not middle-complex concepts. This was determined by measuring the interactions between different parts of the images (ideally pixels, but patches meant it was computationally feasible) such that a strong interaction between parts resulted in greater classification success. Strong interactions (better classification success) occurred with a small number of patches (simple concepts) and a large number of patches (complex concepts) but not a middle number of patches (middle-complex concepts). They call this the Representation Bottleneck and it is in contrast to humans who are less unable to extract much information from few patches (simple concepts) and (according to the paper, but I'm not sure I agree) large numbers of patches but much more from a middle number of patches.

  comment          = {This work used data ``brain predictivity'', how well the model predicted what a brain would produce from an input, as a metric for the goodness of a trained model. They identified different methods of reducing the number of synaptic updates. One interesting discovery was that initialising the network with weights extracted from the distribution of weights of a previously trained networks massively reduces the number of required updates over initialising with standard Kaiming Normal. They suggest that this is analogous to evolution choosing better initial brain conditions.

It could be worth us at our looking at weight distributions in our trained networks and seeing if this is useful for prescribing a weight initialiser for our networks.},

Training to maintain high brain predictivity using Brain-Score as benchmark for this. 4 sub units of brain models in the model, CORnet-S: V1_COR, V1_COR, V4_COR and IT_COR. Aim to reduce the number of synaptic updates whilst maintaining high brain predictivity. Find that initialising brain with ``artificial genome'' by compressing trained weights to distribution which proved much better ``at birth'' than Kaiming Normal weight initialisation (54\% initial predictivity without training). Reduce synaptic updates by freezing earlier brain units - downstream training - or even by freezing all but the final layer of brain units - critical training. Downstream training reduces score but critical training is nearly as good as full training but only requires 5\% of parameters. Final score is 79\% brain predictivity but with only .5\% of the updates. The ``at birth'' initialisation is especially interesting as it may be analogous to brain pre-wiring in primates - and could be something we apply for weight init.},

Now \textbf{``Pretraining is the defacto standard in modern machine learning''}. However, how we then use this pretrained model is still up for grabs. Most popular approaches are finetuning (retrain whole model) or linear probing (only tune the new head). It seems that when the downstream tasks uses data that are in-distribution case, fine tuning works best. However, linear probing works better for out-of-distribution (OOD) data. One reason for this is the new head is initialised with random weights which cause too much adjustment to the pretrained weights. They therefore suggest Linear Probing - Fine Tuning (LP-FT), a hybrid approach which tunes the new head first before finetuning the backbone so that the weights in the head are more attuned to the pretrained weights.

This is relevant to our should we be using pretraining more to create backbones that are then deployed for data from different sensors or platforms. What we don't know is when data fall out of distribution - for example is a new version of an aerial camera out of distribution, or even a different flying year when seasonal conditions have changed?},

One problem is that new head with fine-tuning is randomly initialised so features change too much which these are being adjusted. Suggest Linear Probing - Fine Tuning (LP-FT) alternative to fine tuning which is a two-step approach - tuning the head first, before tuning the model - is an improvement on this which improves on OOD cases - features are changed much less using this approach.},

  comment          = {Whilst this paper is aiming to train networks to be deployed onto identifying different views of the same thing (multiview learning), it seems more generally applicable to me for improving results for downstream tasks which may be somewhat out of domain. Often, classifiers misclassify images because they have learned some spurious aspect of the context, e.g. they use snow in the image to label the dog as a husky. This can mean they fail when the context is unusual, such as classifying a cow when it appears on a beach. To address this, this paper proposes a training approach that maximises that correlation been images of the same class (husky, cow) which then encourages the shared information between examples to be more relevant to the class. This approach also provides the ability to extract the `private`/background, uncorrelated information.},
  comments         = {Spotlight From <https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/spotlight/6062> This paper looks at multiview learning (and possibly improving OOD results? - izzy) by decomposing latent representations to shared (e.g. content, what the label refers to) and private (e.g. context or style) components. Intuition is given with classification of an image of a cow (content) on the beach (context), which can fail because cows in the training data are usually on grass. Using this approach they maximise correlation in similar way to DeepCC and Barlow Twins and find that this is a good objective. This means the shared information can be learned and the private information extracted.},

  comment          = {In a production set-up, ideally a backbone network would be learning continually as new data come in. However, if learning is supervised this requires continuously labelling data. Further, as the domain drifts, ``catastrophic forgetting'' can lead to a model that can no longer perform tasks it was previously good at. This paper looks at solutions to both these and finds that Lifelong Unsupervised Mixup (LUMP) (they also tried Dark Experience Replay) in combination with Barlow Twins (they also tried SimSiam) produces a backbone that responses well over time to a range of downstream tasks. 

I think this paper is very relevant to our's future use of machine learning for image interpretation. It addresses sets out an approach to continually updating backbone networks, as new data are acquired, which doesn't require new labels to be produced. Here's the \github repo: \url{https://github.com/divyam3897/UCL}.},
  comments         = {Oral From <https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/oral/7120> I think this paper is very relevant to OS's use of machine learning for image interpretation. It addresses the issue of continual learning in the case from visual data posted on the web which is unlabelled and for which new problems need to be addressed (e.g. finding real world features for which previous model have not been created). I see that as how we should ultimately be working at OS, we have data continually coming in from different platforms and we want to be able to address new customer problems as they arise. The problem is, to learn for one problem can require a lot of labelled data and can also not help future problems. And as we move onto future problems, ``catastrophic forgetting'' may occur which means that our models stop being able to solve for earlier problems. This paper addresses this using Unsupervised Continual Learning (UCL). They take self-supervised models SimSiam and Barlow Twins (yay, we know about those :-) ) to address the labelling problem - learning representations that can then be used to solve problems as they arise (e.g. as a backbone network). Investigate solutions to catastrophic forgetting by revisiting representations learned on previous tasks: - structural regularization (encourage current task parameters to stay close to previous parameters) - unsupervised replay using Dark Experience Replay (DER) to minimise the Euclidian distance between projected output of current unlabelled task and replay buffer (earlier inputs) task - and propose Lifelong Unsupervised Mixup (LUMP) which interpolates between the examples in the current task and random examples from the replay buffer Using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Split Tiny-ImageNet problems they assess accuracy and forgetting over successive problems for different approaches against a baseline of finetuning the backbone Find that unsupervised approaches perform better than supervised approaches for accuracy and forgetting. The use of LUMP also results in better performance over all other methods. Barlow Twins with LUMP appears to be the best combination for forgetting and is fairly equivalent for accuracy. Evidence that UCL, especially with LUMP, learning more distinctive features (by visual inspection) and also has a loss landscape that is stable and robust (remains consistent over subsequent tasks).

This paper investigates their application in improving training of AlexNets although I'm unconvinced by the results which seem to show that Batch Normalization has the greater impact. However, possibly more interesting and relevant to this section, is that this paper also looks at how well the manifold of each network node separates the classes (its capacity). They find that this varies through the depth with a steep increase at final layers, which may be expected, but is a result of highly varying changes in dimensionality of manifolds and the correlation between manifolds. They also measure the sparsity of the model using the Gini index, finding all models are sparse in the final layer.},

Look at capacity of manifolds for each neuron - the number of separable categories per neuron. This shows that capacity is low for early and intermediate layers but rises steeply in the final layers. This breaks down to high dimensionality (less easy to distinguish) at low at early layer, which increases in intermediate layers and then rapidly drops in final layers. The correlation between manifolds drops to very low (manifolds are farther from each other) at early layers, increases in intermediate layers and then drops off for final layers. Sparsity - measure using Gini index (inequality of income). DN increases sparsity (a bit) through network but at the final layer all models are as sparse.},

Upstream - the upstream perplexity scales with number of parameters but downstream it is hard to predict the accuracy from the number of parameters 2. Depth has a huge impact on performance but other 'knobs' don't do much 3. Existing models tend to not be pareto-optimal, although deep-narrow seem to be better.},

In apparent contrast to the work above in ~\cite{AbnarDNS2022}, this paper finds that ``closed set classification is a good indicator of open set performance``. The contrast may be because there is a subtle difference between close/open set classification and up-/down-stream approaches.

A finding in this work is that the feature representations for unseen classes tend to me smaller than those for seen classes (it makes sense to minimise irrelevant information). Consequently, they suggest replacing maximum softmax with with maximum logit score for open dataset scoring. They also propose the Semantic Shift Benchmark (SSB) dataset, which contains seen and unseen classes that have a true semantic shift rather than a low level shift (such as a shift in image statistics).},

  comment          = {The fact that siamese networks can be trained without negative examples and yet do not collapsing (`dimensional collapse``) to some trivial solution was considered by this paper. The the first approach not to use negative examples was SimSiam (\cite{ChenH2021}) who said that this was because they didn't backpropogate the gradient over one of the encoders (called ``stop gradient``). However, this work finds that the real reason is to do with opposition in the directions of two components of the representation vector (the centre component and the residual). They also refute the claim in work similar to SimSiam, BYOL (Bootstrap Your On Latent) ~\cite{GrillEtAl2020} that batch normalisation is essential.
The paper also gives a nice summary of self-supervised, mainly siamese, approaches.},
  comments         = {Poster From <https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/poster/6629> The paper itself has a nice summary of recently published self-supervised - mainly siamese - approaches. Claims to be similar to the work in BardesPL2021 which introduced VICReg: Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization for Self-Supervised Learning. Contrastive learning has negative examples (''repulsive component'') and this has been thought to help avoid collapse, aka dimensional collapse, aka ``the collapsing problem'' - where the representations learned are constant and trivial (my intuition is that this is like a supervised predictor always predicting the most likely class). SimSiam does not have negative examples and yet does not collapse and it was claimed by the authors that is because it has a stop gradient (not backpropogating the gradient over one encoder) on one side and predictor on the other. Refutes this claim of original SimSiam ChenH2021 paper, first demonstrating that symmetric architectures with and without predictor lead to collapse. Their analysis decomposes the ($l_2$ normalised) representation vector into the centre component (the average/expected value for this vector), as approximated over the mini-batch, and the residual component. Collapse is when all vectors approaches the centre component and the opposite is desirable. They look at the contribution of these two components to the negative gradient when a negative sample is supplied and find that the negative centre component provides de-centring and the negative residual provides de-correlation. Demonstrate that this unifies InfoNCE and SimSiam. Also, from their paper, I learn that an earlier work refuted claim that batch normalisation is essential in BYOL (GrillEtAl2020).},

  title            = {Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass},
  comment          = {Describes the reality of ghost work, based on 5 years of study including detailed interviews with ghost workers. Great story telling as well and good consideration of how ghost work fits into the history of employment, especially casual labour, and how it can be much better supported to the benefit of workers and, to an extent, the recipients of their work.

Both the ghost workers and and those who receive their work tend to be treated as customers of the platform, e.g. MTurk that facilitates the work. Most don't allow the workers to be identified by any more than an id code and so job creators have no sense of the person behind the work. Workers can lose out because others get to the job sooner, someone deems their work inadequate or just technology glitches. There is no recourse and no feedback e.g. on how to do the job better another time.

Ghost work fills in technology's last mile - the bit that always requires humans no matter how much technology is advanced. p53. We never seem to replace the need for human effort. p175-6

Uses the Pareto distribution to describe workers - a core small percentage do the vast amount of the work. Whereas an employer would have previously expected all their workers to distribute the workload so that most people are required to perform the bulk of the work, by using ghost work platforms they are starting to use the Pareto distribution for recruitment - avoiding the cost and risks of traditional recruitment. p103-103

Workers don't share a work site, hour or professional identity, which are key ingredients to organising workers interests. p118

Despite this, workers do find ways to collaborate - to reduce costs (signing up, avoiding scams, finding work, and getting paid); to get work done, and; to recreate the social side of work. Ghost work relies on the kindness of strangers. p122 - 123

Chapter 6 addresses how ghost work should be progressed. A few ghost work platforms are aiming at a 'double bottom line' by aiming to make money and have the other goals such as environmental and social benefits. These companies see humans in the loop as assets, a ``commons of talent'' to draw from not a fungible raw material. p141

Some ghost work platforms also use 'scaffolding' to support their workforce - bringing together teams of experienced and novice workers who bring knowledge and new insights into the work mix.

Liken Ghost Work to piecework of the 19th Century 
``It's also true that the long march toward automation has historically created new needs and different types of human labor to fill those needs. In this respect, the new, software-managed work world shares features of the factory jobs that assembled cars by placing workers on a production line where and when they were needed most. It also resembles the so-called piecework that women and children did on farms in the 19th century, assembling matchstick boxes for pennies a pop. And it overlaps in obvious ways with the outsourcing of medical transcription and call center work to the Global South that boomed with the expansion of the internet in the late 1990s.'' p8

``As the Industrial Revolution got under way and machinery began to automate the production of certain goods, such as textiles, the availability of piecework exploded. Piecework (also called “industrial homework,” “putting-out work,” “cottage industry systems,” or “commission systems”) was the part of manufacturing or processing a product done by a person when a machine hit its limits. Piecework jobs were broken down into small, distributable tasks that could be carried out off-site, without stopping production or diverting resources away from the factory floor.7 Assembly lines depended on old divisions of labor. Women and children living at the margins of cities dominated the expendable piecework labor pools.8 In effect, industrial piecework was the first iteration of paid, on-demand ghost work.''},

Local authorities are currently much more interested in compensating the affected households in kind, namely by providing new homes in resettlement sites as a strategy to avoid the creation of new informal settlements. In this context, a resettlement site is an issue of fundamental concern for both the targeted communities and the policy makers. Understanding affected households' preferences regarding resettlement site attributes is crucially important if such relocation projects are to be successful in the long term. This study explores the preferences of affected households for resettlement attributes and compares them to the opinions of professional planning officials. Findings revealed similarities as well as significant differences between the two groups' opinions on what are the important resettlement sites' attributes. The paper further analyses the spatial implications of the two groups' preferences on the suitability of residential areas in the city. Differences in opinions led to different spatial suitability maps of the existing residential areas. Given the substantial spatial implications of the divergent views, selecting a resettlement site based on both stakeholder groups' views would be essential to contribute to more effective and conflict-free resettlement processes.},

Literature shows that most African people have never tested the democratic system being enjoyed, and sometimes taken for granted, by most citizens in many western countries. Using examples from some selected African countries, this article argues that some undemocratic regimes which are characterised by human rights violations managed to get and remain in power because of the support they received and continue to get from some major International Finance Institutions (IFIs) and bilateral donors. It also argues that while these institutions claim to use their financial aid to promote democracy and human rights in their rhetoric, they contradict themselves in practice by failing or cutting aid from local institutions that promote democracy or by supporting undemocratic and authoritarian governments despite overwhelming evidence proving that the governments being supported violates human rights of their citizens. While the author recognises that no country should be left to fend for itself in case of emergency or disaster such as a hurricane or earthquake or genocide, one of the main recommendations of this article is that of making human rights and competitive multi-party democracy a cine qua non-prerequisite for any form of aid. The author believes that doing so will create basic conditions for establishing, and possibly upholding, democratic rule in African countries which refuse to willingly establish democratic rule and respect human rights.},

''Maps, since their conception, are instruments of linguistic imposition, and during this imposition the truth of some is more equal than the truth of others; the perspective of the experts generally being that which determines value. Feminist readings of space seek a wider perspective of a space predicated “man as generic citizen''. The challenge is to find those other views that make up the space, and what are the repercussions and impact they have when they are seen through feminist cartography. ``

On the impacts that these cartographic representations can have, Catherine D'Ignazio, Associate Professor of Urban Science and Planning in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT and author of the book Data Feminism, states in an interview for this study that:

 ``If you are developing these maps that talk about adequate schools, there is also a role for technology in deepening that inequity and potential gentrification. People are going to take action and make decisions based on these maps. It can further stratify different social spaces. This has to be part of a feminist analysis because the object of research does not end with the production of the map, but has to look at what the map does in the world, the stories about people that the map tells us. We have tremendously segregated cities, so when you produce a map like that, you're also using a proxy to exacerbate racial segregation in society.''

Undertakes qualitative analysis across four dimensions - ethics, feminism, geospatial data and cartography, using literature reviews, interviews with academics, people from the sphere of civil society and feminist activists, and an analysis of existing ethical frameworks (including Locus Charter).

List recommendations along 4 axes: technical, political, epistemological and communities and describes the feminist approach with specific detail on what to do and a what not to do. 

Technical example: Transparently document the process for reproducing data and findings
Political example: Make the scope and impact of the map clear, recognising potential bias in the process
Epistemological example: Revise your belief system with respect to knowledge production
Community example: Make it clear what, whom, and under what banner the final map will appear

Also propose a reflection matrix for working with geospatial data that asks reflective questions before, during and after map-making.

''It can be concluded through this research, that in academia, civil society organizations and activists, there is no common framework regarding the ethical treatment of geospatial data.''},

  abstract         = {Biofuels are included in many proposed strategies to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and limit the magnitude of global warming. The US Renewable Fuel Standard is the world's largest existing biofuel program, yet despite its prominence, there has been limited empirical assessment of the program's environmental outcomes. Even without considering likely international land use effects, we find that the production of corn-based ethanol in the United States has failed to meet the policy's own greenhouse gas emissions targets and negatively affected water quality, the area of land used for conservation, and other ecosystem processes. Our findings suggest that profound advances in technology and policy are still needed to achieve the intended environmental benefits of biofuel production and use. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) specifies the use of biofuels in the United States and thereby guides nearly half of all global biofuel production, yet outcomes of this keystone climate and environmental regulation remain unclear. Here we combine econometric analyses, land use observations, and biophysical models to estimate the realized effects of the RFS in aggregate and down to the scale of individual agricultural fields across the United States. We find that the RFS increased corn prices by 30\% and the prices of other crops by 20\%, which, in turn, expanded US corn cultivation by 2.8 Mha (8.7\%) and total cropland by 2.1 Mha (2.4\%) in the years following policy enactment (2008 to 2016). These changes increased annual nationwide fertilizer use by 3 to 8\%, increased water quality degradants by 3 to 5\%, and caused enough domestic land use change emissions such that the carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24\% higher. These tradeoffs must be weighed alongside the benefits of biofuels as decision-makers consider the future of renewable energy policies and the potential for fuels like corn ethanol to meet climate mitigation goals.},
  comment          = {''Bioenergy is an essential component of most proposed pathways to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 or 2°C by middle to late century (1-6). Liquid biofuels may contribute to bioenergy's share of climate mitigation by displacing petroleum-based fuels with those generated from modern-day plants (7, 8). The GHG benefits of such substitution, however, are dependent on several factors including'':
- whether biofuel production invokes additional plant growth (9-12), 
- the extent to which combusted plants (typically crops) are replaced in the food system (13-15), 
- the degree to which biofuel production directly and indirectly alters patterns of land use and management (2, 16-20)

''Because land use changes (LUCs) and other consequences induced by biofuels have the potential to cause significant novel GHG emissions and modify other ecosystem services and disservices (21-26), accurately estimating and accounting these outcomes is critical for the formation of effective climate and environmental policy (27-29).''

Studied the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) between 2008 to 2016 and found:
- RFS stimulated 20.8 billion L (5.5 Bgal) of additional annual ethanol production, which requires nearly 1.3 billion bushels of corn after accounting for coproducts that can be fed to animals (46)
- heightened demand led to persistent increases in corn prices of ~31\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 5\%, 70\%) compared to BAU
-  increased demand for corn also spilled over onto other crops, increasing soybean prices by 19\% [-8\%, 72\%] and wheat by 20\% [2\%, 60\%]
- increase in corn prices relative to other crops increased the area planted to corn on existing cropland by an average of 2.8 Mha* per year [95\% CI: 2.4, 3.1], which is an 8.7\% increase attributable to the RFS
-  produced a net increase in cropland area of 2.1 Mha [1.8, 2.5] relative to BAU
-  intensity of corn production and extent of cropland caused 7.5\% more reactive nitrogen (N) from synthetic fertilizer to be applied annually to the landscape
-  increased total edge-of-field phosphorus (P) runoff by 3.2\%
- Combined, the RFS-driven changes in cropland area between 2008 and 2016 caused a total net C flux of 397.7 Tg CO2e [313.3, 481.7] to the atmosphere

Cleaning one will cause the clean one to deteriorate. Preserving will have no impact on either. Similar study again with a development slated to go ahead on on a marsh or a forest and participant choose to alow it to go ahead or relocate it to the other. This latter experiment showed a definite action bias - towards moving the development - even though moving it would result in the other resource being damaged.

Two types of imagery: Aerial over USA - National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and Landsat 8 over Earth

Features used for search initially come from last few layers of pretrained ImageNet ResNet - results good but wanted to improve

Binarise features by injecting noise in training which forces the the weights towards 0 or 1. Than at inference simply threshold at 0.5.

Customise for aerial and satellite data. Training NAIP imagery against OSM classes (as they did for TerraPattern). Great line ``We emphasize that this supervised learning step is not used to produce a network that is good at identifying particular object classes (although it does ultimately do better on these classes), but rather to create a network that produces features that are useful for generic visual search on aerial and satellite imagery'' - sounds like every time we write about Toponet.

For Landsat data used unsupervised approach an autoencoder to compress the 2048 features.

Can use the features for direct search (Hamming distance between query image and others) or hash-based search (a hash of the feature vector).

Future directions look familiar too:
We see three clear future directions for extending the work presented here.
• Multi-scale search - The current system searches at one spatial scale, namely square images that are 128 pixels across. Instead we would like to enable search over a handful of spatial scales, both smaller and larger than 128 pixels across.
• Geospatial filtering - The current system searches across all images that have been indexed, regardless of their geographical location. In the future we would like to enable geospatial filtering, e.g. only return results from Japan.
• Temporal filtering - The current system searches across a single image layer. Although the images within this layer were acquired at different times, that temporal information has not been used in the search. In the future we would like to enable temporal filtering, e.g. only return results that were acquired in May 2018},

Rather than training image encoder and text encoder so that the correct label for the image is predicted, this approach trains the two encoders such that the correct label is paired with the image. At test time, the leaned text encoder synthesizes a zero-shot linear classifier by embedding the names or descriptions of the target dataset's classes.

Contrastive objective is more efficient than label prediction. Also, they find that the resulting models are more flexible and can be turned to fine-grained object classification, geo-localisation, action recognition in videos and OCR. 

CLIP does struggle on more abstract or systemmatic taksks such as prediction how close the nearest car is in an image, and has poor generalisation to images not covered intraining.

the UK Government's commitment to developing a new Digital Strategy, must go far beyond the traditional silo of `digital' and recognise that all aspects of our lives are, and will increasingly be, a hybrid blend of online and offline interactions.

Without urgent Government action we risk:
• services being digitalised, sometime badly, for cost-saving reasons, without understanding the impact on those who use them;
• people feeling (and being) constantly, electronically, monitored at work, working longer and longer hours, unable to switch off or maintain a separation between work and home;
• thousands, maybe millions, of jobs being lost to automation with no plan in place to provide the skills and training needed for those affected to move into the new jobs that will be created; and
• a variety of digital trends and local government funding constraints combining to reduce our opportunities to meet with others. From automated check-out tills, to pub and library closures, homeworking and digital personal trainers, there is a legitimate fear that the digitalisation driven by one pandemic could result in another: a pandemic of loneliness.

The Government should make a careful assessment of the climate change implications of the hybrid world and adopt policies to mitigate any negative impact.

Addresses with details and potential solutions:
• Digital inequality; e.g. “11\% of households do not have internet access”
• Skills and training; Digital Skills Gap
• Data and research; ``unless we have a robust evidence base to help us understand the impact of digitalisation on different communities, and the effectiveness of different digital services and interventions, we will not be able to make the most of the digital future''
• Co-operation; Working in collaboration ``Communities have a wealth of knowledge about what will work best for their members, and it is by listening to their views and experiences that we can ensure that interventions will have the biggest, and best, impact.''
• Resilience; regulation and rights; ``any threat to digital infrastructure will threaten our ability to work, access essential services, buy groceries online, and access our money through online banking''
• Online harms. ``there is an urgent need for comprehensive research to explore the relationship between digital technology and wellbeing, particularly amongst children and young people. This research must go beyond screen time alone, and must also consider the experiences of marginalised and vulnerable young people.''

Also looks at specific issues when digitalising health, education in schools, work (including gig economy), social interaction

Paper from Google

Train network to learn the id of documents (intuition: document id not document class - as many classes as documents). A sequence to sequence task

Don't train with the whole document, but take e.g. the first L tokens, or a randomly sample contiguous set of tokens, or de-duplicated set, or... (the first seems to work best, I think)

id is output as a string

Try generating semantically structured identifiers so that similar documents have similar ids. This is achieved using ?BERT and do hierarchical embeddings to cluster. Don't seem happy with these and suggest looking at alternatives.

Works better with smaller data sets.
Works better with larger models.
Works better for shorter tokenisation of documents (similar to dataset size).
Compare to BM25 which is standard for search

Weights are differentiable so it can be incorporated into another neural model, e.g. in reinforcement learning when an agent needs to store data for later retreival.

Could anthropogenic climate change result in worldwide societal collapse or even eventual human extinction? At present, this is a dangerously underexplored topic. Yet there are ample reasons to suspect that climate change could result in a global catastrophe. Analyzing the mechanisms for these extreme consequences could help galvanize action, improve resilience, and inform policy, including emergency responses. We outline current knowledge about the likelihood of extreme climate change, discuss why understanding bad-to-worst cases is vital, articulate reasons for concern about catastrophic outcomes, define key terms, and put forward a research agenda. The proposed agenda covers four main questions: 1) What is the potential for climate change to drive mass extinction events? 2) What are the mechanisms that could result in human mass mortality and morbidity? 3) What are human societies' vulnerabilities to climate-triggered risk cascades, such as from conflict, political instability, and systemic financial risk? 4) How can these multiple strands of evidence—together with other global dangers—be usefully synthesized into an “integrated catastrophe assessment”? It is time for the scientific community to grapple with the challenge of better understanding catastrophic climate change.},

One way to do this is to forgo ownership of certain consumer goods, such as cars. Although proponents of sufficiency claim that car shedding (i.e., giving away a vehicle so that the household no longer has its own car) might increase subjective well-being (SWB), there is little empirical evidence supporting this. This paper aims to help fill this gap by adding empirical evidence on the relationship between car shedding and SWB. Data from the Swiss Household Panel is used (2006-2017) with a fixed-effects model assessing the year-to-year changes in evaluative and affective well-being (life satisfaction, leisure satisfaction, joy, and anger) before and after car shedding. Separate analyses for non-affordability-driven and affordability-driven car shedders were conducted. Results show that non-affordability-driven car shedding has a positive effect on feelings of joy one to three years after the event. Affordability-driven car shedding, in contrast, is associated with a decrease in leisure satisfaction and feelings of joy up to three years later. Levels of positive affective wellbeing already decrease in anticipation of affordability-driven car shedding. A sufficiency measure like non-affordability-driven car shedding is not associated with reducing SWB, and this may have policy implications.},

Averaging can can be as a single hit or it can be 'greedy'. The latter averages the master weights with a new model's weights and retains this average as the master model if the validation accuracy improves (discards it overwise).

DARPA model is used as a positive example of entrepreneurial state. Block 2008 identifies characteristics of this model:
	- Relatively small offices with budget autonomy permitted to proactive
	- Funding goes to heterogeneous groups (universities, startups, firms, consortia) without distinction between basic and applied research
	- Mandate includes helping firms get products to stage of commercial viability
	- Part of role is linking ideas, resources and people in constructive ways

Use the iPhone (and Apple more generally) to illustrate how technological transformations are dependent on government investment in R\&D chapter 5

Use clean tech as example of how different governments are driving innovation. China and Germany both have coherent policy frameworks around clean technology both by driving demand and supply. In contrast, US, UK and other ``European Laggards'' are ``deploying patchy strategies'' without clear direction or long-term incentives p124

The ``death valley'' stage is the bit between successful proof of concept and full testing and approval and is often the stage at which firms (and ideas?) die. Brazil has been financing biotechnology firms past this stage p131

China has formally incorporated mitigating climate change into it economic strategy. Its green development strategy recognises that that future competitive advantage depends on effective resource management and it plans make ``profit'' and ``environment'' complementary pursuits. Generally p132 makes some really interesting points about China

In contrast UK's approach is ``stop-start'', established programmes have had funding cut and policies especially around technologies such as CCS are ``misguided'' p133

UK approach is based on notion that all is needed is a ``nudge'' from the state, but no other technological revolution has succeeded this way p134

As a result the UK is falling behind in green tech after being one of the countries that was catching up p135

Assumption is that venture capitalists are the risk-takers providing funding to generate innovation. But they have been shown to be risk-averse and operate to return on their investment in short term which is incompatible with transformative innovation. ``If VCs aren't interested in capital-intensive industries, or in building factories what exactly are the offering in terms of economic development? Their role should be seen for what it is: limited'' p141

ARPA-E tries to emulate DARPA's idea that it always expects and tolerates failure p144

ARPA-E's mission statement says that ``scientists are free to explore energy innovation without the expectation that all ideas will work or produce immediate commercial value, which fills the research gap created by business interests too risk averse to invest in the energy technologies of tomorrow given the uncertainties of today'' p145

Government funded R\&D in US massively reduced the cost of wind energy due to a range of discoveries and innovations. Then the withdrawal of funding caused the domestic market to stagnate and momentum for the industry moved to Germany p161

''Clean technology is already teaching us that changing the world requires coordination and the investment of multiple States: otherwise R\&D, support for manufacturing and support for market creation and function remain dead ends while the Earth literally suffocates on the industries we built a century ago'' p168

The challenges for new technologies are often political or social, seldom technical:
Commitment from patient capital, nurturing risky new industries, support for deployment that requires transition away from industry which has sunk costs (and is thus in the short term cheaper) p173

The cumulative innovation curve and that VCs are able to capture the value not only of their investment but also in the state investment in the work that has gone before meaning their return is out of proportion with their investment p182

An MIT study found that long-term basic and applied research not part of big business any more leading to large holes in the [US] industrial ecosystem (that presumably will mean that future innovation will not have the same innovation as that based on past research from R\&D centres like Bell Labs, Xerox PARC and Alcoa Research Lab p193

The financial sector is a parasitic drain on the economy, its share of the profits outstripping those of the real economy - and GDP counts their interest rates as a service (its rent) and the risk is assumed by the state because it is ``too big to fail''. In other sectors there are similar disfunctions - in life sciences the riskiest research is undertaken by the state but then big pharma cashes in on the outputs. In clean technology, wind and solar struggle to gain a foothold yet the executives and shareholders reap millions in returns underwritten by the state. Further, those benefitting, e.g. Apple, pay barely any tax that could fund future technological development. p196

Elements required to build an entrepreneurial state:
	- Golden share of IPR to the state and a national innovation fund meaning that innovation can be fairly and broadly shared (with the first mover still able to recover costs)
	- Income-contingent loans and equity that bring back value to the state from success innovations - socialise the rewards
	- Development banks have been shown e.g. in Germany, Brazil and China with a remit to invest and to draw back in value for the next round of investment p203-5},

Background
Human impacts on earth-system processes are overshooting several planetary boundaries, driving a crisis of ecological breakdown. This crisis is being caused in large part by global resource extraction, which has increased dramatically over the past half century. We propose a novel method for quantifying national responsibility for ecological breakdown by assessing nations' cumulative material use in excess of equitable and sustainable boundaries.
Methods
For this analysis, we derived national fair shares of a sustainable resource corridor. These fair shares were then subtracted from countries' actual resource use to determine the extent to which each country has overshot its fair share over the period 1970-2017. Through this approach, each country's share of responsibility for global excess resource use was calculated.
Findings
High-income nations are responsible for 74\% of global excess material use, driven primarily by the USA (27\%) and the EU-28 high-income countries (25\%). China is responsible for 15\% of global excess material use, and the rest of the Global South (ie, the low-income and middle-income countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia) is responsible for only 8\%. Overshoot in higher-income nations is driven disproportionately by the use of abiotic materials, whereas in lower-income nations it is driven disproportionately by the use of biomass.
Interpretation
These results show that high-income nations are the primary drivers of global ecological breakdown and they need to urgently reduce their resource use to fair and sustainable levels. Achieving sufficient reductions will likely require high-income nations to adopt transformative post-growth and degrowth approaches.
Funding
None.},

The analysis reveals how the emerging field of SPIS drew upon a growing range of disciplines in the late 1950s and 1960s, and how the relationship with these disciplines evolved over time. Around the mid-1980s, substantial parts of SPIS started to coalesce into a more coherent field centred on the adoption of an evolutionary (or neo-Schumpeterian) economics framework, an interactive model of the innovation process, and (a little later) the concept of `systems of innovation' and the resource-based view of the firm. The article concludes with a discussion of whether SPIS is perhaps in the early stages of becoming a discipline.},
  comment          = {Attempt to detemine the most influential works in the field of science policy and innovation studies (SPIS). Field is about 50 years old. ``First large scale quantitative study'' treat books on equal basis to articles.

SPIS definition from the Research Policy journal: ``devoted to analyzing, understanding and effectively responding to the economic, policy, management, organizational, environmental and other challenges posed by innovation, technology, R\&D and science. This includes a number of related activities concerned with the creation of knowledge (through research), the diffusion and acquisition of knowledge (e.g. through organizational learning), and its exploitation in the form of new or improved products, processes or services''

``characterised by the terms innovation, technology, R\&D and science, is studied using a range of social science disciplines (economics and economic history, policy studies, management science, organisational studies, sociology''

economics, economic history and business history, policy, management (including new product management), organsiational studies, sociology of innovation - especially diffusion but less sociology of science and technology because this comes more under science and technology studies (STS).

SPIS is possibly a discipline in its own right (p1237) to the point that it is now rare to have articles written by people in industry. [iz: is this good?]

Go into detail on the pros and cons of their method (p1222)

Using these quantitative measures of impact, this paper says that despite being a ``relatively new and still quite small field'' it has make a ``significant number of advances comparable in impact [to] economics'' p1222

Should return to for very short summaries of key papers, developments and authors in the field. 

Idea of ``science push'' linear model of innovation which arose from Vannevar Bush's influential [1945] science policy report to the US Government entitled Science the Endless Frontier.

Schmookler 1966 ``Invention and economics growth is credited with the demand-pull model'' of innovation.

``Kline and Rosenberg [1986] ... effectively ended the `science-push' versus `demand-pull' debate ... argued that one needed to move beyond simple linear models and instead put forward an interactive `chain-linked' model of the innovation process''

Nelson and Arrow on economics of research.

''Knowledge industry'' including patents and much more from Machlup which became known as knowledge economy.

Heller and eisenburg [1998] Patents can give rise to 'anti-commons' because they deter innovation.

Vernon 1966 Product-cycle theory of trade, four stage model of the product cycle in which new goods are developed in industrialised countries and spread to developing countries.

Organisational learning, learning organisation, intelligent enterprise - ideas developed around firms that are able to develop and apply innovations.

Organisational psychology has contributed work around stimulation of the productivity of researchers ``autonomy, interaction with colleagues, the balance between pure and applied research, and some degree of tension between personal and organisational goals''.

''early 1980s witnessed the emergence of what has gradually become for many a common conceptual framework based around evolutionary economics, the interactive model of the innovation process, and, a little later, the notion of `systems of innovation' and the resource-based view of the firm''

''Kanter [1983], ... demonstrated how overly `segmentalist' management could create barriers to innovation, contrasting this with a more integrative style of management which is likely to result in productivity improvement and innovation''.

''Drucker [1985] focused on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, arguing that entrepreneurship is not a specialist talent of a few gifted individuals but is pervasive in a healthy society, not just in the private sector but also in public service organisations. He also warned against infatuation with new technology-based innovation to the detriment of often more important social innovations''. Later (1993) ``argued that we are witnessing the emergence of `post-capitalist society', in which the primary resource for creating wealth is knowledge''.

''Piore and Sabel {1984}, who argued that capitalism had reached a turning-point, where it has to choose between two alternatives - to continue along the existing trajectory of mass-production technology (the course chosen at the first `industrial divide'), or to switch towards craft-based production and exploiting computer technology to make possible `flexible specialisation', thus creating an environment in which firms compete on the basis of innovations but cooperate with regard to developing the necessary technological knowledge and skills.''

''resource-based view of the firm as an alternative to the transaction-cost theory of the firm''. ```in-house knowledge of technology' as one of a firm's key resources''

Related to systems of innovation: Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000 triple helix: universities, industry and government. Universities were initially for teaching, then `first academic revolution' they took on the function of research in the 19th Century, now 'second academic revolution' when taking on `third mission' of contributing to the economy and society. [izz: each revolution has downplayed the importance of those earlier roles].

Gibbons et al [1994] knowledge production can be Mode 1 - universal theories, basic research - and Mode 2 - applications. [Iz: debate about which came first, in fact]

Some of this has come out of particular institutions, e.g. SPRU (and Project SAPPHO), PREST at Manchester University, Centre for Policy Alternatives at MIT, Harvard. The list of highly cited publications is heavily dominated by US-based authors although this papers suggests a range of reason why they may be.

  abstract         = {{With the field of innovation studies (IS) now half a century old, the occasion has been marked by several studies looking back to identify the main advances made over its lifetime. Starting from a list of 20 advances over the field's history, this discussion paper sets out 20 challenges for coming decades. The intention is to prompt a debate within the IS community on what are, or should be, the key challenges, and more generally on what sort of field we aspire to be. It is argued that the empirical focus of our studies has failed to keep pace with the fast changing world, especially the shift from manufacturing to services and the increasingly urgent need for sustainability. The way we conceptualise, define, operationalise and analyse `innovation' seems somewhat rooted in the past, leaving us less able to grapple with other less visible or `dark' forms of innovation.}},
  comment          = {What was science policy and innovation studies (SPIS) is possibly now just innovation studies (IS). 

this papers looks at what IS should be doing, such as considering the direction of innovation and not just assuming that all innovation is good.

Twenty challenges for innovation studies

1 	From visible innovation to `dark innovation' 
Innovation may not just be technology and manufacturing, other innovation exists but this is perhaps hidden or 'dark'. explains this with imprinting theory - that institutions have values and norms based on their formation and so technology and manufacturing would have been the focus for IS several decades ago. this focus is probably also reflected in the measures of innovation activity. 

Schumpeter had a broader perspective on innovation,  whilst still using manufacturing terms he was not restricted to product or process innovations.

Other innovations may be in organisations, incremental process innovations in factories, services, social (social media), grassroots. Also 'salami publishing' cutting a piece of work into smaller parts to publish separately. Self- plagarism or worse not referencing the other works.

2 	From innovation in manufacturing to innovation in services 

3 	From `boy's toys' to the liberation of `housewives' 
Interesting table, reflects interests of researchers rather than breadth of innovation?

4 	From national and regional to global systems of innovation 
The challenge to IS researchers is to identify, map and analyse these global systems of innovation and their interactions with national and regional systems ( Lundvall 2007 ; Soete et al. 2010 )

5 	From innovation for economic productivity to innovation for sustainability (`green innovation') 
''… innovation is a vector, rather than just a scalar quantity. ( Stirling 2008 : 263)''
''The 1990s saw increasing concern with environmental damage, the using up of scarce resources, and global warming. ... was regarded as rather `flaky' by some in IS, although it is now having a significant impact (e.g. Geels 2002 )''

6 	From innovation for economic growth to innovation for sustainable development (from Lundvall)
The challenge for IS scholars is to respond to the pressing world need for more equitable development, working with others on development studies and sustainability

7 	From risky innovation to socially responsible innovation 
''damage to the environment, less desirable working conditions or other adverse effects on the quality of life'' - questions whether the risk is higher or if awareness is greater and argues for more participatory approaches to decision-making, constructive technology assessment, consensus conferences or citizens juries p436

8 	From innovation for wealth creation to innovation for wellbeing (or from `more is better' to `enough is enough') 
Shift the focus from m-wealth to r-wealth

9 	From `winner take all' to `fairness for all'? 
''as innovation has become more collective and `open', the rewards have become increasingly individualised'' Mazzucato etc 
''wider belief that extreme wealth for a few individuals is a necessary facet of free-market capitalism''
Questions whether IS should be passive and just observe or in fact have a duty to explore how greater fairness could be achieved.

10 	From government as fixer of failures to the entrepreneurial state 
From Mazzucato
Many Nobel prizes to those who've claimed to prove that gov intervention causes innefficiencies. Much like innovation, maybe innovation policy need to be more experimental.

11 	From faith-based policy (and policy-based evidence) to evidence-based policy?
from Steinmueller
Policy makers tend to be politically wedded to a particular policy and don't draw on evidence . Difficult to build evidence as double-blind policy trials are difficult/impossible.
 
12 	Balancing the intrinsic tensions between intellectual property and open source 
highlights difference between pharmaceuticals in which patenting is apparently a big incentive to innovation, whereas in open sourcing software seems to be an incentive

13 	Balancing the intrinsic tensions between exploration and exploitation 
some organisations do both well, others do one or the other, what conditions are required for each?

14 	Balancing the intrinsic tensions between closed and open innovation 
Absortive capacity of organisation to take in innovation and new ideas. Open innovation has been used as a reason to remove R\&D capacity (someone else will do it) - but this couuld reduce absorptive capacity.

15 	Balancing the intrinsic tensions between competition and cooperation 

16 	Pricking academic bubbles 
Even academics have a tendancy to follow trends and also competition for scarce funding can encourage the raising of expectations. Also may be danger of being uncritical of Schumpeter (Iz: and Mazzucato?)? 

17 	Identifying the causes of the current economic crisis 
''Financial innovations such as sub-prime mortgages, collateralised debt obligations and credit default swaps all played a central role in creating the crisis, giving rise to a process of `destructive creation' ( Soete 2013 ).'' ``Here, it is not so much that IS researchers contributed to these financial innovations. Rather, it is that we almost completely failed to provide any analysis and understanding of them, or to offer any warnings'' (except Nightingale et al''

18 	Avoiding disciplinary sclerosis 
Intellectual in-breeding, less adventurous, more theory-driven less policy-driven, 

19 	Helping to generate a new paradigm for economics: from Ptolemaic economics to??? 
''Like Dosi (2011) , I sense that economics today is eerily reminiscent of Ptolemaic astronomy with its complicated epicycles'' ``If there is to be any chance of success, the IS community will need to join forces with newer and more sympathetic subfields of economics such as behavioural economics, experimental economics and ecological economics''

20 	Maintaining our research integrity, sense of morality and collegiality
self-policing in other areas (parliament, journalism, ...) has been shown to be ineffective. When there's competition for resources, signs of integrity and social capital eroding.

This paper looks at (supervised) training of ViTs more efficiently and identifies some methods (using ImageNet, so not sure how applicable it would be to RS data for instance). 
	
Pre-training with lower resolution images is faster and can result in better classification outcomes
	
Training examples also had random cropping - a square that likely to retain the image's subject taken from the low res image (this was enough because they had squillions of images)
	
By using very strong colour transforms of the data and believe this encouraged the ViT, which is apparently less sensitive to object outlines than CNNs, to focus more on shapes
	
Stochastic depth regularisation skipped layers randomly and so forced individuals layers to play a greater role
	
LayerScale uses learnable scaling parameter for the layers which effectively allows the network to accumulate more layers as it learns},

These include techniques from service design research that focuses on user experience and co-creation practice; and strands of evolutionary economics that focus on shifting and shaping technology and innovation frontiers and managing complex systems under conditions of uncertainty.''

Nice description of market-fixing reasoning and goes on to explain how this ``dominant analytical framework and its tool is not fit for purpose'' (because major challenges cannot be reduced to 'externalities' or 'public goods'.

Growth has a direction as well as a rate (see also Entrepreneurial state or Mission Economy?)

Regarding innovation `top-down' can stifle innovation while `bottom up' ``can make it dispersieve with little impact''.

How can public value be understood - small discussion of participatory evaluation, opinion polls. stakeholder workshops, citizen's juries. Others have tried to determine a monetary value e.g. contingent valuation.

How Government Digital Service was so successful - Mike Bracken threw out efficiency targets and brought in user-focussed KPIs.

The public value of the BBC is not just the niche aspects that other broadcasters would not produce, but also the more commercial offerings - rather than crowding out other broadcasters but supports innovation in these areas and also thus reaches a wider audience with all its output

Constraining state budgets so that spending is balanced by tax etc. neglects the important aspect of state spending that encourages growth

Discussion of the weaknesses of cost-benefit analysis, even social cost-benefit analysis, which are very short term in their outlook because they compare to status quo

Go on to suggest frameworks and principles applied to policy evaluation, such as systems thinking and systems dynamics which are more appropriate for complex, dynamic systems.

Core characteristics of complex systems:
- Hetergeneous agents
- Fundamental uncertainty
- Path dependence
- Disproportionality of cause and effect
- Emergence
- Absence of optimatlity

Real-time data, progress against milestones, measreus of cross-sectoral and cross-science impact, 

accept tension between top-down and bottom-up!

Deleidi studies demonstrated a larger multiplier affect with mission-oriented innovation

''Dynamic efficiency involves making the best use of resources
to achieve changes over time and so is concerned with innovation, investment, improvement and growth - including, perhaps most importantly, the creation of new resources (technologies) and shifting technology frontiers (Huerta de Soto 2009).''},

It didn't offer what should be done once the paradigm of ``sustainability'' as he understood it had been dropped. This book, he says, addresses that issue.

I've read only the preface and prologue. I understand from these that the book is founded on a ``vicious syllogism'' with the four premises and conclusion:
1. if we don't keep below 2.0 degrees, we're in for dangerous, unpredictable, potentially catastrophic climate change
2. If we don't limit global emissions to 1,300 bn tonnes CO2e, we shall not stay below 2.0 degrees
3. If we haven't already minimally embarked on limiting emissions we will not limit them to 1,300 bn tonnes
4. We have not now even minimally embarked on such a programme
- Conclusion: We are in for dangerous, unpredictable and potentially catastrophic climate change

Each COP seems to be a ``last chance'' - global alarm clock on snooze - we are still not admitting that destructive climate change is coming. He makes the point is that denial is also something that ``the good guys''.

Argues that progress is over. Letting go has four themes:
Tragedy, not problem
Now, not the future
Wildness, not well-being
Hope, not optimism

1. no sampling or label bias
2. sampling bias but no label bias
3. no sampling bias, but label bias
4. both sampling and label
However, two versions of each are created:
Experiment A - the sample and label imbalance is completely removed
Experiment B - the data balance is unmodified from the original dataset

Trained elastic net logistic classier

With each set of predictions, tested 6 metrics:
- Difference in Means
- Difference in Residuals
- Equal Opportunity
- Equal Mis-opportunity
- Disparate Impact
- Normalized Mutual Information

Metrics were not very good at differentiating between bias and legitimate imbalances in the data

Metrics were more sensitive to sample than label bias

There is no established threshold to most fairness metrics and response is dataset-dependent and so comparison of metrics should be compared against a known unbiased result

In 1841, Friedrich List, motivated to determine how Germany could overtake England in industrial development, identified that more than ``material'' capital was required. He cited ``mental'' or intellectual capital as important.  ``Germany developed one of the best technical educational and training systems in the world …  overtaking Britain in the latter half of the 19th century'' 

The system of Innovation includes education, including non-teaching such as museums and events and government assistance and direction, etc

In the late 19th century Germany industries innovated by introducing the in-house R\&D department. In-house R\&D became more prevalent after the second World war. The dominant idea of innovation was science and technology push - The Linear Model - with R\&D being seen as the source of innovation. In the 50s and 60s, however, evidence that diffusion of innovation was more important to economic growth than being the first in the world with the radical innovations. Also social innovations were as important as technical innovations.

In the 80s and 90s it became evident that incremental Innovations came from areas other than R\&D such as production engineers technicians and from interactions with the market.

Comparing Japan with the USSR whilst both invested a similar amount in in R\&D in the 60s and the USSR invested more in the 80s. Japan made greater gains in industry. Much of their investment was in civil research. They had greater social, technical and economic linkages in their system than the USSR, where incentives for higher productivity were low. Similarly comparing South Korea (and possibly South Asian countries) with Brazil (and possibly South American countries), aspects that led to greater growth in SK appear to be greater education as well as investment in R\&D, but also more automation and better use of communication technologies.

With globalisation there has been debate over whether increasing standardisation of products and processes has occurred, indeed whether we should be talking about an interlinked economy or ILE transnational and multinational corporations. However the evidence remains that not only is R\&D in multinational organisations still very much focused in the original country but also that due to uncertainty, localised learning and bounded rationality, there may be increasing diversity of products. ``Neoclassical assumptions [about] perfect information are at the border lines of credibility and usefulness''. In terms of diffusion of innovations whilst incremental Innovations may easily diffuse over borders radical Innovations would require changes in production capability and social and institutional frameworks and so national systems of innovation become an extremely important concept.

Questions posed, not necesarily answered are around:
what are public values, to whom do they apply and how does private enterprise relate to them?
can public value be assessed (I guess measured?)
what are the relationships between public values, how to they fit together, conflict, is there a hierarchy or are some contained by others?

Based on review of ``leading (largest circulation) public administration periodicals in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavian countries and studies chiefly published during the period 1990-2003'' and claim these ``represent very different positions on the spectrum of the welfare state and, perhaps, different views about public values''

Result is 72 registered values, grouped into 6 ``constelations''. Values associated with:
 - the Public Sector's Contribution to Society
   - Common good
     - Public interest
     - Social cohesion
   - Altruism
     - Human dignity
   - Sustainability
     - Voice of the future
   - Regime dignity
     - Regime stability
 - Transformation of Interests to Decisions
   - Majority rule
     - Democracy
     - Will of the people
     - Collective choice
   - User democracy
     - Local governance
     - Citizen involvement
   - Protection of minorities
     - Protection of individual rights
 - the Relationship Between the Public Administration and Politicians
   - Political loyalty
     - Accountability
     - Responsiveness
 - the Relationship Between Public Administration and Its Environment
   - Openness-secrecy
     - Responsiveness
     - Listening to public opinion
   - Advocacy-neutrality
     - Compromise
     - Balancing of interests

   - Self-development of employees
     - Good working environment
 - the Behavior of Public-Sector Employees
   - Legality

     - User democracy
     - Citizen involvement
     - Citizen's self-development
   - User orientation
     - Timeliness
     - Friendliness

Also consider the proximity of values and identify some nodal values, that seem to be related to many other values (human dignity, sustainability, citizen involvement, openness, secrecy, compromise, integrity and robustness). Other prime values, which are valued for themselves, and instrumental values, which enable other values to be achieved.

Conclusion
 - Public Value Is Not Governmental
 - Many Public Values Are Prime Values But Cannot Be Distinguished on That Basis Alone
 - Public Values Analysis Is Both Causal Inquiry (Instrumental Values) and Philosophical and Moral Inquiry (Prime Values)
 - Values Relationships Are Many and Unwieldy But Must Be Sorted Out},

  abstract         = {The purpose of the paper is to describe and explain sectoral patterns of technical change as revealed by data on about 2000 significant innovations in Britain since 1945. Most technological knowledge turns out not to be “information” that is generally applicable and easily reproducible, but specific to firms and applications, cumulative in development and varied amongst sectors in source and direction. Innovating firms principally in electronics and chemicals, are relatively big, and they develop innovations over a wide range of specific product groups within their principal sector, but relatively few outside. Firms principally in mechanical and instrument engineering are relatively small and specialised, and they exist in symbiosis with large firms, in scale intensive sectors like metal manufacture and vehicles, who make a significant contribution to their own process technology. In textile firms, on the other hand. most process innovations come from suppliers. These characteristics and variations can be classified in a three part taxonomy based on firms: (1) supplier dominated; (2) production intensive; (3) science based. They can be explained by sources of technology, requirements of users, and possibilities for appropriation. This explanation has implications for our understanding of the sources and directions of technical change, firms' diversification behaviour, the dynamic relationship between technology and industrial structure, and the formation of technological skills and advantages at the level of the firm. the region and the country.},
  comment          = {Using database of innovations that are labelled according to their sector, this paper makes a number of observations and theories about the nature of innovation in Britain, accepting that the database does not contain a complete view [Iz: it doesn't contain knowledge/data industries and innovation].

Because the data are not complete, don't attempt to make statistical inference but do cross reference with statistical analysis for US by Scherer (1982)

Consider questions like “science and technology push versus demand pull” (see also Scherer and Schmookler refs), whether product or process innovations dominate, and the importance of organisation size.

In general, they find that it is very hard to make generalisations across sectors.

Organisations are grouped into categories:
- Science-based firms (much R\&D, drawing on other's R\&D, e.g. chemical and electronic sectors; innovation develops basic science and engineering)
- Supplier-dominated firms (small with weak in-house R\&D and engineering, e.g. manufacturing, agriculture, housebuilding; innovation is cuts costs)
- Scale/production-intensive firms (pin factories!; innovation increases productivity)
- Specialised equipment suppliers (supply equipment and knowledge)

Considers the sector of
- The source of the technology used
- The source and nature of the technology produced
- The characteristics of the innovating firm

And thus create a taxonomy of innovations has 5 possible combinations between a), b), and c) all being the same and them all being different

Most knowledge comes from within the same sector

Product innovations == improvement in performance of capital goods == innovation used outside of the sector

Process innovations == cheapening of capital goods == innovations used inside the sector},

Land -> natural resources, some are exhaustible
scarcity leads to rationing by the market, regulation or other process 

Air and water have limited capacity to absorb and assimilate waste

The assimilative capacity of air and water is provided free of charge for anyone with waste to dispose into. This resource is becoming scarce 

The normal price of products that result in pollution does not reflect the scarcity because the costs of pollution do not fall on polluter but on society 

Piecemeal regulation can transfer harm, eg. geographically

Subsidies are hard to administer because may need to be based on the improvement in conditions 

Taxes and charges can be based on absolute pollution, which is more straighforward. However, this could lead to costs that disproportionately impact the poorest (although inequality can/should also be addressed)

It isn't easy to set the price of tax because its difficult to determine the full cost of pollution 

Discusses Mills's proposed materials-use fee that is charged on the removal of material from environment. The extractor fee is refunded to anyone who can demonstrate that they have returned the material to the environment - with level set by how safely, completely etc the materials have been disposed of

We don't consume-just transform materials between forms.

One of the fundamental ideas in this book is that the increase of consumption leads to a requirement for more administration and management of good consumed. With the demise of servant roles, there is a rise in the ``crypto-servent house-wife''. The housewife, as with the entrepreneur and small business owner working for more than they are paid, are all receiving compensation in the form of ``convenient social virtue''.

Discussion of inequality in the system p93

Identifies that ``bureaucratic symbiosis'' between private corporation and related public body e.g. MOD and weapons firm p159

''it is the pursuit by the technostructure of its own goals, exercising its own power to do so, and not technological innovation per se that is at the heart of the environmental problems'' p166

The transnational system internationalises the tendancy to inequality ... modern imperialism p 191

nice explanation of externalities ``external diseconomies of production'' (diseconomies is just costs) p223

''economists abuse that which they love'' in reference to financial support of small firms (which are foundation of market theory) which large firms simply attract such support due to their power p272

Discussion of executive income and its taxation p287-8

Separate to industries that form technostructures, there are ``retarded industries'' that cannot achieve this. These include medical care, housing, transport infrastructure. Yet these become even more necessary with the increase in consumption p296-7

Propose an alternative approach to policy evaluation based on public value as collectively understood by stakeholders that include the market, the state and civil society based on literature review for five years up to 201, review of policy cases and the outcomes of a workshop in 2019. 

Key conclusions:
- Diverse range of appraisal and evaluation practices as well as real-time monitoring (e.g. dashboards) that challenge traditional approaches
- Policy evaluation includes retrospective reviews alongside prospective methods
- Reflexive capabilities that cover various public frames such as economic, legal and organisational dimensions
- Identified 80 different policy evaluation and appraisal methodologies from cost-benefit analysis to social fabric matrices, asset mapping and public value mapping
- 35\% of literature referred to market-fixing, 46\% to market-shaping and 24\% to non-market-oriented frameworks
- Alternative evaluation methods are being taken seriously by the academic and specialist community
- Market fixing frameworks are heavily reliant on quantitative models whereas market-shaping analytical methods are more diverse, e.g. agent-based modelling and living labs
- Policy-makers are using alternative tools far less 
Recommendations

Issues neglected by neoclassical and also evolutionary and structuralist contributions:

- learning in production - learning is not just in R\&D, but policy [iz: and management!] disconnects learning from production
- macroeconomic management - the management of the economy is as important as industrial policy to achieve national objectives
- conflict management - ``successful implementation of any
policy requires management of the conflicts that it causes and/or of existing latent conflicts that it unintentionally stirs up''

Also detail new realities in economies:
- Shifting organization of global production, new patterns of accumulation, value creation and capture - leading to extremely powerful organisations, small enterprises cannot fully participate in global value chains
- Increasing financialization of the world economy - focus on shareholder value, performing share buybacks, doing much less in core activity of organisation, pushes economies into spiral of dis-investment and de-accumulation
- Changes in the rules of the global economic system - imperialism, old and new - rich countries ``impose `monetarist' macroeconomic policies on the developing countries in macroeconomic trouble, while conducting more `Keynesian' policies when they face similar problems themselves''},

It refers to a broader range of development goals (including the structural transformation of the economy) and focuses on problems like the resolution of coordination failures and collective-action problems, the conflicting issues of commitment and accountability and the need for balancing the trade-offs they generate, some ingredients of state capacity and political coalition building usually missed in the literature, the possible importance of rent sharíng in a political equilibnum, the advantages and problems of political centralization and decentralization, and the multidimensionality of state functions that may not be addressed by markets or private firms.},
  comment          = {Say that the state provides a framework for law and order, enforcement of contacts and other institutions underpinning the market, yet constrained so as not to interfere with property rights. State also important for incentive frameworks of investment, enterprise and development. This paper considers development more broadly than others. Probably the discussion is more nuanced than I am currently able to detect and there's a lot about property rights that I simply don't understand as it seems to be essential to ``growth''.

Discussion of what is a strong state. This requires political centralisation (as opposed to local jurisdictions) and willingness to make commitments (despite diverse interest groups). There is a very long discussion of capacity.

There needs to be limits to government to prevent capture by special interest groups.

The state must be pluralistic to represent diverse groups.

Note the possible conflict between centralisation and pluralism. England had apparently historically managed to balance these. 

Contrast collectivist (e.g. East Asian) with individualist societies, the former helping the state's capacity more.

Goes on to discuss political decentralisation which enables greater local accountability, but had higher risk of capture. Notes that more mobile societies are less prone as electorate more aware.

Another problem with decentralisation is the devolution of responsibility without the corresponding funds - unfunded mandates.

Democracy is slow but if it has legitimacy is stabilising and curbs excesses of capitalism. There are plenty of examples of powerful interests undermining accountability processes and politicians dispensing benefits for votes.

Apparently, voting behaviour is significantly influenced more by recurring benefits arranged by local governments than by even large one-time benefits.

Discussions of developmental state and also public enterprises and Public-Private partnerships. Putin gets some mentions.},

''A recent review suggest that strategies towards ​efficiency have to be complemented by those pushing ​sufficiency (Parrique et al 2019), that is, `the dir​ect downscaling of economic production in many ​sectors and parallel reduction of consumption' ​(p 3). Although concrete political strategies towards ​sufficiency—or degrowth—are still fragmented and ​diverse, they may include restrictive supply-side ​policy instruments targeting fossil fuels (instead of ​relative efficiency improvements), redistribution (of ​work and leisure, natural resources and wealth), ​a decentralization of the economy or new social ​security institutions (that complement the growth​ oriented welfare state). Recently suggested policies ​include moratoria on resource extraction and new ​infrastructures (e.g. coal power plants, highways, air​ports), bans on harmful activities (e.g. fracking, coal ​mining), the reduction of working hours and redis​tributive taxation, instead of just putting a price on ​resources and emissions (Schneider et al 2010, Kallis ​2011, Koch 2013, Sekulova et al 2013, Jackson 2016, ​Green and Denniss 2018, Hickel and Kallis 2019). A ​new study suggests, however, that even energy suffi​ciency actions may be associated with rebound effects ​and negative spillovers (Sorrell et al 2020).''

Find very little evidence of absolute decoupling, and these only for short period. Some evidence of relative decoupling. Mainly decoupling is due to efficiency and so little decoupling from energy used. No evidence that current rates are enough to reach climate goals. Also, decoupling was for production not consumption. Some evidence of reducing in material resource use or ``dematerialisation''. 

Grouped studies as having either ``green growth'' or ``degrowth'' agenda, it other. Very little in degrowth. Still most studies valued growth, some implicitly more than environmental goals.

Evidence that causality between GDP and resource in both directions. Past material and energy use is also relevant.

No novel policy recommendations in those papers that gave any. Rarely demand side policy to reduce consumption.

Suggest that sufficiency as well as efficiency is vital to meet climate goals and using measures of well-being better than GDP.

  title            = {Automation and the Future of Work},
  comment          = {Early discussion of machine p7 (bottom)

The labour share of income in G7 countries has fallen for decades p9

The automation theory argument is that technical change has reduced the demand for labour p11

This book argues that 1. The decrease in labour is not due to technical change but economic stagnation; 2. This manifests as under employment; 3. Inequality will not be addressed because elites accept/welcome low pay of workers; and 4. Abundance is possible without full or hourly full automation

De-industrialisation is due to over-capacity and global competition p24-5

Depressed prices resulted in reduced profits and lower investment and thus lower productivity improvements. The only way to stay afloat is taking market share from others (and buying back shares). Increased robotisation maintains competitiveness and, in fact, jobs because these companies/countries remain in operation p26


Manufacturing has been a unique driver of growth p34

Workers are leaving the manufacturing pool into service jobs which are low productivity p35

Instead of capital investment, companies are buying back their own shares (financialisation) p35

Services are also mostly non-tradeable so no use for international market therefore developing countries try to expand into manufacturing p37

So it's no technical dynamism but increasing stagnation 

The gap between productivity and output growth determines the demand for labour. The automation discourse says that jobs are being lost to automation (productivity) but this book argues that we have overcapacity and so demand relative to output is falling. P39

Major destroyer of livelihoods in the 20th century was not “silicon capitalism” but nitrogen capitalism - the green revolution p42

With increasing unemployment in 70s and 80s, and beyond, Governments changed welfare payments form short-term support to an inducement to work (by reducing their value) p47

Because there are fewer jobs and welfare is lower, people accept decreasing pay and conditions p47-8

Originally, job protection was for those job taken by the `main breadwinner'. Other jobs were less important and so were less protected. Now families relying on these unprotected roles for their main/sole income p50

Keynesian stimulation was attempted as divestment increased from 70s. But this counter-cyclical investment didn't stimulate high economic growth, private investment was not encouraged despite low interest rates p66-8

Keynes said that such conditions “economic maturity” require the shrinking of labour supply, e.g. a reduction in working week rather than in increase in the labour demand p69

This was also Beveridge's 1944 plan, but it wasn't enacted

Due to competition, people should by the cheapest product. If productivity cannot be improved then wages have to decrease to retain a competitive position p60

OECD was formed to increase labour flexibility i.e. reduce labour protections p61

“Automation is lot like global warming: when people take it seriously, they find themselves willing to consider revisions to the basic structure of social life that they otherwise would have thought impossible” p65

Large asset owners will lose power as the state invests. They therefore threaten “capital strike” to prevent state investment, thus “radical Keysianism”. Beveridge was defeated by the capitalists p70-1

There's a discussion of UBI, by both left- and right-wing versions p72-9

UBI does not separate income from assets - large asset owners retain the power p78 and control over investment decisions p79

Argue that the post-scarcity world and the steps needed to get there need to be imagined  - automation may not free us from work p82

Historic discussions of post-scarcity: The ancient Greeks distinguished the free world (citizens) from the necessary world (slaves). Thomas More divided a person's life into these realms - emancipating servant and this influence Marx and others p83-6

“Once necessity is assured, everyone is free to develop their individuality outside the bounds of any given community” p90

“The first thing people would actually do in a post-scarcity world … work to mitigate or reverse climate change and to make up for the centuries of inequality that followed colonialism” p92-3

“Economic growth never frees us from the need to grow more” p93},

4. Accelerating the shift in zero emissions vehicles
5. Green public transport, cycling and walking
6. Jet Zero and green ships

1. High electrification
2. High resource (low carbon hydrogen)
3. High innovation

on the use of greenhouse gas removals to meet our targets.''

''UK Emissions Trading Scheme as a key driver of our path to net zero''

''it will be necessary to consider whether broader reforms to our market frameworks are needed to unlock the full potential of low carbon technologies to take us to net zero''

''CCUS will be critical to achieving net zero, alongside low carbon alternatives such as low carbon hydrogen and electricity''

''Government aims to support this shift in the 2020s through policy measures that inform consumers of the embodied carbon of industrial goods and empower them to make choices that support more efficient use of resources''

''Over the 2020s, we will need to start taking more decisive steps about which technologies and infrastructure should be rolled out, where and when, and accordingly, where we need to target investment, skills, and other enabling actions''

''By the early 2030s, CO2 transport and storage infrastructure availability could potentially constrain GGR deployment, as the significant overall expansion of CCUS projects creates competition for access to the network''

Green jobs taskforce reported in July 2021 with three themes across the “life cycle” of green jobs: driving investment in net zero to support good quality green jobs in the UK; building pathways into good green careers; and supporting workers in the high carbon economy to transition.

Principles underpinning green public and business choices
1. Minimise the `ask' by sending clear regulatory signals
2. Make the green choice the easiest
3. Make the green choice affordable
4. Empower people and businesses to make their own choice
5. Motivate \& build public acceptability for major changes
6. Present a clear vision of how we will get to net zero and what the role of people and business will be

''The research method used to categorise and analyse academic degrowth proposals is Grounded Theory (GT). GT is an approach that allows the researcher to inductively construct theory about a certain issue in a systematic manner (Strauss and Corbin, 1990).''

''The difference between the ecological and neoclassical perspectives leads to different policy-making objectives. Daly (1992) defines three policy objectives for ecological economics, which have been widely applied in this research field (e.g. Deepak, 2010; Lawn, 2001; Stewen, 1998). The objectives are, in order of relative importance: (1) sustainable scale of resource use, (2) fair distribution of income and wealth, and (3) efficient allocation of resources''

Grouped degrowth topics into 3 broad goals:
1. Reduce the environmental impact of human activities
2. Redistribute income and wealth both within and between countries
3. Promote the transition from a materialistic to a convivial and participatory society

As well as identifying the ecological economics policy objectives addressed, they considered whether proposal where local, national or international and whether they were top-down or bottom up

Most proposal had a national focus and were top-down in approach, indicating that state has a large role to play despite the dominant narrative of transformation from grassroots. 

Also, literature is more focused on social equity than environmental sustainability.

Find that objectives behind proposals are sometimes unclear and say there is a need to look at degrowth proposal as components of strategy.

Studies show some positive impacts on consumer choice but not always

Key challenges
- Labelling needs to also be understood as valuable for its impact on the producer
- High carbon emitters may be resistent to labelling and lead to weaking of schemes
- Labelling schemes are not panaceas and will not reduce emissions on their own
- Quantification needs to be accurate, this require transparency and can also aid more wider attempts to detect greenwashing. Economy-wide labelling would enable better understanding of emissions for border adjustment on other instruments},

  comment          = {Using our complexity science lens, we isolate 9 categories of interventions to accelerate action, as follows. 

First, public engagement on climate could be stronger. As recently as March 2020, 61\% of the British public were either completely unaware of the concept of “net zero emissions” (42\%) or had heard `hardly anything about it' (19\%) (BEIS, 2020b). These figures are improving, however. By September 2020, 53\% had heard nothing (30\%) or hardly anything (23\%) about net zero. The announcement of the Prime Minister's “Ten Point Plan” in November 2020 has also presumably increased awareness. Deeper public engagement with the changes ahead is necessary (see section 3.1). 

Second, the transition, while net positive, will create winners and losers. The losers should know that they will be supported through the transition to ensure social justice (section 3.2). Without such support, progress could falter or stop completely. 

Third, the institutions of government are not geared up for such a mammoth effort. Political leadership can come and go, bold decisions can be shied away from, and trade-offs made where achieving net zero is not the top priority. A reorganisation of government is required (section 3.3). 

Fourth, some of largest polluters do not face the biggest penalties. Following the polluter pays principle, we recommend continued efforts on carbon pricing, the removal of fossil subsidies, and a `carbon takeback obligation' requiring firms who extract or import fossil fuels to put an increasing proportion of the carbon back in the ground (section 3.4). 

Fifth, the UK has a role in leveraging global dynamics (section 3.5) in the transition, particularly as host of COP 26. This means embracing the fact that the UK can affect emissions beyond its borders, and that action can and should be taken to complement domestic measures. 

Sixth, we note the role of business in embracing net-zero and suggest how to build on growing business climate ambition (section 3.6). 

Seventh, ongoing global technological advances are occurring, and we suggest opportunities for the UK to intervene, where appropriate, to accelerate technological trends, for the UK's, and the world's benefit (section 3.7). 

Eighth, we acknowledge the work being done to align the UK's business and financial systems to the world's climate objectives and suggest Paris-aligned accounts as a simple way to accelerate this (section 3.8). 

Ninth, but not least, we note how incremental changes to the UK's legal frameworks can help unlock faster progress (section 3.9).},

''

This book contains the most sustained and serious attack on mainstream, neoclassical economics in more than forty years.

Richard R. Nelson and Sidney G. Winter focus their critique on the basic question of how firms and industries change overtime.

They marshal significant objections to the fundamental neoclassical assumptions of profit maximization and market equilibrium, which they find ineffective in the analysis of technological innovation and the dynamics of competition among firms. To replace these assumptions, they borrow from biology the concept of natural selection to construct a precise and detailed evolutionary theory of business behavior.

They grant that firms are motivated by profit and engage in search for ways of improving profits, but they do not consider them to be profit maximizing.

Likewise, they emphasize the tendency for the more profitable firms to drive the less profitable ones out of business, but they do not focus their analysis on hypothetical states of industry equilibrium. The results of their new paradigm and analytical framework are impressive.

Not only have they been able to develop more coherent and powerful models of competitive firm dynamics under conditions of growth and technological change, but their approach is compatible with findings in psychology and other social sciences.

Finally, their work has important implications for welfare economics and for government policy toward industry.

It is organisations—including household families, business enterprises and government agencies—and not markets that invest in the productive capabilities embodied in physical and human capital that generate productivity.''

''In sum, the theory of the firm in perfect competition is a firm in which entrepreneurship and management play no roles.''

Marx:
''If all commodities exchange for the value of the quantities of labour embodied in them, Marx asked, what is the source of capitalist profit, i.e. surplus value?''

''Marx argued that the tendency of capitalist development was to generate a `reserve army' of unemployed labour that would keep wages at a culturally determined minimum—the dark side of market forces —while giving capitalist employers the power to extract high levels of labour effort, and hence surplus value, from their employees in the production process''

Marx predicted that automation would results in male workers being replaced by cheaper labour - women and children. This didn't happen because cooperation between workers and capitalists resulted in increase in productivity even with increased automation. Further, innovation is driven by this process leading to the ``innovative enterprise''.

''Innovation is a collective, cumulative and uncertain process.''

''The innovative enterprise develops productive resources through collective and cumulative learning processes ... `` (organisational learning). the costs of this are offset by the ability of firm to gain greater market share - outperform firms who are merely optimising - and overcome technological and market uncertainties. 

However, still competitive uncertainty and so much invest in human capital. This also requires government spending on public goods and often utilises subsidies and other government support.

Also shift in lifestyle

Setting directions, missions, change can be accelerated

Describes tech revolutions with most recent one in detail: constraints were in imagination and finance, business and government trying to return to business as usual and market led prosperity

Supply was then aided by organisational changes but this needed demand, which was supported by the creation of the welfare state

Note we are looking at smart revolution in tech but environmental crises mean green revolution in lifestyle: smart green

Green is a direction for innovation and investment. Tech is enabler of local, 'traditional'

Vital to nurture the lifestyle aspiration especially in growing countries China and India

Also need to shift to intangible products and also redesign regulatory frameworks, social behaviours. Some of this is being seen in EU.

Environmental risks and disasters are likely to pay a role in the shift

- Mutually compatible and reinforcing

Say's Law, ppl will work to produce products earning wage which they will spend on those products. Keynes rejected this.

Classical economics assumes full employment and no involuntary unemployment, which became obviously a false premise in 1920s

Keynes initially challenges government policy and argued for deficits funding of programmes to reduce unemployment in 1920s but couldn't do this until he produced a general theory in 1930s

Keynes introduced quantity theory of money, that amount of money in system has impacts. Considered investment expenditure, creates extend precariousness and instability, a consumer multiplier, household and firm expenditure.

Different interpretations of Keynes:
Hydraulic
Fundamentalist
Modified equilibrium
      Prices are sticky, wages (a price) do not flexibly change with shocks. 

But it seems Keynes was misinterpreted and it may be that Keynesian isn't Keynes's

Leijonhufvud presented main Keynes innovation as about private enterprise market economy responds to demand shocks when which price and wage flexibility and complete information are nothing more than fiction

Leijonhufvud also refers to what comes later (rational expectations) as ``... movies: more and more simple-minded plots but ever more mind-boggling special effects''

Akerlof presents case for strengthening macroeconomics by incorporating cognitive biases, reciprocity, fairness, herding and social status

Wellbeing - of humans and non-human life and ecosystems
Radical shifts in values
Degrowth business

Degrowth business is a firm whose operations are aimed at, and correspond to, economy aimed at downscaling of economic activities via material and energy throughput reduction, increase in wellbeing, alongside a shift in values. 

Degrowth business is for the satisfaction of needs, focus no longer on profit-maximisation. No longer growth, capitalism, productivism, consumerism, competition, etc

A firm should understand that economy and society are embedded within the biosphere and operate accoridingly

Some businesses are suitable for degrowth, others (e.g. fashion, advertising) may not be

Ends with question of how to measure success under this regime?

Gives a thorough background to orthodox ideas of public administration theories and practise and why it is being rejected by some economists.

Markets are always imperfect and thus not `constrained Pareto-efficient'. This left to analysis that looked at 'net-welfare benefit' which led to one of the main justifications for cost-benefit analysis.

Market failure is only necessary condition of government intervention. However, it is not sufficient because 'bureau-maximising' behaviour of state departments means that intervention should only occur if benefits outweight costs of market- and government-failure.

Because of government failture, New Public Management argued that governments should adopt value-maximising strategies with efficiency targets etc.

In contrast, Moore developed `public value account' which was absorbed into Blair/Clinton 'Third Way' and included measuring outcomes and evidence-based approach to definitions of value that changed over time.

Similarly, Stoker argued for `public value management'.

From Ostrom, co-production developed with user-shaped and personalised public services. In particular, the Government Digital Service rejected the New Public Management ideas and focused on the role of citizens as users. Similarly, BBC presented concept of public value to justify public funds.

There are limitations of PVM e.g. around methods of measuring the value to the public, and that public can change views and even hold multiple views at one time.

Description of how laissez-faire can only exist paired with interventionism  and discussion of actual use of instruments such as taxation. Great for references.

This paper argues for moving beyond idea that public good is not about fixing a market failure but an end in itself. Collective value creation, new ways to engage the public, new evaluation indicators, consideration of how value is shared.

Founded on the distinction that Schumpeter drew between two contexts for action:
- neoclassical: when economic activity occurs in a continuous circular flow, actors have full understanding
- evolutionary economics: when innovation is going on, actors can never understand full the context

Goes on to demonstrate how neoclassical economics and the market organisation has a poor link to much in technology policy - e.g. incentives for public good and externaties. It is `intellectually strained' to raionalise much of the public realm (air traffic control, public health, etc) because of market failure.

Virtually all R\&D yields externalities - others can learn from this R\&D. Firms are often knowledgeable about their fields and can direct their research with incentives such as patents. But basic research is often better understood in the public sphere and here the interest is in open science.

The issues is not whether markets fail but how to get the job done.

Thinking of innovation as a system with multiple diverse actors and instruments does not require recourse to market failure. Institutions evolve and policymaking is a continuing process.

Goes into detail the innovation around pharmaceuticals. Patents are important for profits but contraversial because it can lead to ``evergreening'' and limits to access by low income countries.},

``Problems to be mitigated by innovation policy must be identified and specified in innovation terms ... system, i.e. a low innovation intensity (or a low propensity to innovate) of a certain category of innovations (product, process, etc.)''

quoting Edquist and Zabala-Iturriagagoitia, 2013: it is necessary to also know the causes behind the problem identified — at least the most important ones

Choice of instruments:
1. a primary selection of the specific instruments
2. the concrete design and/or `customization' of the instruments
3. the design of an instrument mix

``Policy instruments are not neutral devices'' and popular acceptance can impact their outcome.

Choice of instruments may differ even if goals are similar

Identfying problems can be achieved using:
- innovation indicators
- foresight exercises 
- benchmarks and best cases
- independent expert assessment

Categories of policy instruments:
1. regulatory (``sticks'')
2. economic and financial (``carrots'')
3. soft (``sermons'')

Regulatory instruments may be important indirectly, e.g. by restricting supply of inputs they incentivise innovation with different inputs

Most economic instruments operate on the supply side - development and diffusion of innovation. An example of demand-side is public procurement of innovation (PPI) - China is doing this

Soft instruments, often termed `governance', is growing and ``transformed the role of the government from being a provider and regulator to being a coordinator and facilitator [9]''

Lists 10 activites in the system of innovation and says that instruments will act on one or more of these. These are divided into four groups:

1. Idealising theoretical rationales and policy makers
policy rationales are likely to acreete in layers because new ideas are implemented in a landscape shaped by older ones. `Policy monopolies' and `policy entrapreneurs'

2. Treating policies as tools from a toolbox
But `interpretive flexibility' - policies carry different meanings from time to time, place to place, actor to actor. Not necessarily stable over time and do not work in isolation.

3. Too much faith in rational design coordination of `policy mixes'
Somewhat critical of BorrasE2013: ``Whilst the OECD acknowledges the significant co-ordination challenges presented by the sheer complexity and flexibility of the mix of policies likely to have an influence on innovation processes, [BorrasE2013] downplay these challenges. In their idealised approach, coherence will come from careful attention to problem identification and policy mix design''. But policy mixes have emergent behaviour. Scarce evidence for the value of `systemic' instruments and `strategic policy intelligence' tools such as foresight exercises to build more coherent policy visions.

4. An atemporal approach to innovation policy
dynamics unfold and interact over time, goals, rationales and instruments will emerge, evolve and fade away. Adaptive implementers are needed.

Identify some ways forward
- study of innovation processes for highlighting possibilities and challenges for policy implementation
- mutual adaptive co-ordination, informed by contextual knowledge
- pay more attention to the role of agency in making and breaking policy path dependencies and the roles institutions play in enabling and constraining action
- includes learning from failure, active experimentation and trial and error
- draw attention to uncertainties and trade-offs, such as the balance
between decentralised experimentation and the need to learn and rapidly transfer lessons, or the wider hidden complexities, uncertainties, and trade-offs between inevitably conflicting policy goals, encouraging open debate and shedding light on the hidden politics behind innovation policy choices


Useful for references for studies of innovation policy implementation in different countries and sectors

Craig Berry's summary:
1. Don't idealise the theoretical rationale of policy-makers - they are not passive recipients of policy recommendations
There are multiple policy actors with varying interests, knowledge, biases
Need to see policy as just as layered and evolutionary as innovation; e.g. policy-makers may hold onto `market failure' rationale even as systemic thinking emerges
1. Don't treat policies as tools from a toolbox
Instruments have different meaning and application in different contexts
Little evidence that any one set of innovation policy tools is most effective
1. Don't put too much faith in rational design and coherent policy `mix'
`Public policy necessarily pursues a broad and ever-changing range of more or less explicit and implicit, final and intermediate goals and objectives. It must also react to urgent and often unforeseen problems'
1. Don't forget path dependency

Chapter 2: Covers traditional policy analysis, its nature, history and current state. Later in the book, say that ``this approach assumes problems can be solved'' p143

Chapter 3: A second way of applying policy is around our organisation and organisations

Discussion of how we organise to deliver on policy. Economists have dominated in policy because, unlike sociologists and political scientists, they are willing to make predictions. 

Economists would have it that decisions relating to public goods (e.g. healthcare or education) should be made by the service user (who may not know best or have a broad knowledge base) or provider (who may be conflicted by any fee that they receive).

Chapter 4: A third way is to perform research to identify solutions.

Discussion of science and technology policy. This has tended to be about natural not social sciences. But just because physics is a powerful discipline, does not mean we can apply it to solve the problems of the world.

Significant advances in the social science method are required. Questions about who decides what research is done, and how. The outcomes of research should be considered a public good and scientists allowed a degree of autonomy. Economists see this differently though.

Chapter 5: The three traditions set out on chapters 2-4 (poliucy analysis, organisational design and research direction, are all confident that solutions can be found . But there is overselling of poorly evidenced prescriptions. Economists with concepts, logic and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) ``the rigor of their arguments has tended to bedazzle the eyes and to take away from the shabbiness of their predictions'' p76.

We probably need a new way of looking at policy problems at least a combination of existing traditions. 

Chapter 6: A detailed study of childcare provision - a policy problem. 

Private for-profit is not fully trusted and public provision is perceived as uniform. The market doesn't work because there is not perfect information and so some way of allowing observation of childcare in progress is needed. Also non-profit organisations don't tend to expand if the need increases so a body is required to oversee this to encourage increases in provision where required.

Chapter 7: A study of state sponsored R\&D into supersonic flight and nuclear energy.

The state supports agriculture, medicare but supersonic flight and nuclear don't fit in here. In the US, these were supported because some individuals in government could see that rate development was not matching its potential. Success in technology cannot be orderly. CBA does not go deep enough.

Discussion of change, adaptation and responses with respect to the organisation and innovation p137

Organisations have, separately: demand, supply and innovation generation. However their interaction is essential. p139

Discussion of regulation of supply, the flexibility of supply and the quality of supply p141

The producers interests should count for very little - the consumer should be priority. p151 
But CBA nets the consumers' losses with the producers' gains p152

Geels Multi-level perspective (MLP) theory of transitions has been developed since first publication 2002  by developing ideas, in response to criticism and by other authors. This paper takes the MLP theory and looks at other related theories in different fields and compares them with MLP, highlighting aspects that are borrowed and are crossovers.

This is a useful paper to return to for detail on MLP as well as the related theories of Social construction of technology (SCOT), Evolutionary economics and Neo-institutional theory.

The basic idea MLP is that technological innovations occur in niches. Some will gradually building up internal momentum and may place some pressure on the wider socio-technical regime (e.g. markets, industry, policy, science, etc) which may resist the change. The regime also exists within a wider socio-technical landscape which is external. Developments in the landscape also puts pressure on the regime and the niches. Changes in landscape open up windows of opportunity for the innovations to break into the regime which both changes the regime and the landscape.

SCOT sits within the Science and Technologies Studies (STS) field (this is discussed in Martin2012). ``innovation is a social process of aligning heterogeneous elements, which involves actors moving between spheres such as science, markets, regulation and production.'' Core notions from SCOT within MLP are that the MLP conceptualises technologies as socially constructed, rather than developing according to an internal technical logic, shares the broader STS assessment that science and technology are omnipresent in modern societies, and have contributed to major transformations in agro-food, energy, transport, housing, entertainment, and communication in the last two centuries.

``Evolutionary economics has two complementary components, which are relevant for transitions and the MLP. Macro-evolution addresses long-term techno-economic patterns ... Schumpeter (1939: 102) ... Micro-evolution concerns mechanisms of variation, selection and retention that underlie genealogical lineages and trajectories ... '' NelsonW1982. The ideas of transition are part of MLP (later MLP accommodates more gradual transitions, however). The regime, technological trajectory and path dependence in MLP are derived from evolutionary economics. Other aspect of MLP come from evolutionary biology.
 
Neo-institutional theory: Institutional theory is important, because “rules, norms, and belief systems undergird all stable social systems, including economic systems” (Scott, 2008: 437). Fits especially with the regimes aspect.


``Institutional theory emphasizes that organizations operate not only in economic environments, but also in institutional environments'' - competition is for social fitness, which arises from appropriateness or legitimacy. These may influence reputation, license-to-operate, access to capital and government support are 

Transitions research

``Framing struggles are consequential because it matters if a problem like climate change is framed as a `market failure' (which would lead to market-based instruments such as a carbon tax) or as a `planetary boundary' (which may lead to stronger regulatory or innovation policies with greater urgency). It also matters how specific innovations are framed: are wind turbines seen as renewable energy technologies or as ugly artefacts that spoil the landscape and kill birds? Are nuclear plants framed as low-carbon technologies or as existential threats? The implication is that transitions should not only be seen as techno-economic management challenges, but also as socio-cultural processes which involve wider publics and cultural meanings.''},

``degrowth postulates that indefinite economic growth on a finite planet is impossible; facilitating growth as the overarching aim of socio-economic policy will eventually lead to involuntary economic decline with far-reaching social and political consequences''

Paper identifies that theory is well-versed by hypothesis testing and empirical results are lacking. It also needs to be more inclusive of marginalised poor. 

Also identifies wider benefits of degrowth (than just on environment) such as reduced psychological stress and increase community collaboration

  - Against the people's basic principles of living and working hard
  - Growing (e.g., healthy crops, creativity) is part of EJ agendas
  - Austerity is a ``degrowth strategy for poor people''
- Beyond detached terms, detached ideas \& approaches	
  - Multiple meanings of ideas in multi-cultural, pluri-national countries
  - Degrowth is too anthropocentric
  - Issues framed differently from how Southern groups organize and discuss problems
- Communication (\& dissemination) issues	
  - Still scant mention of Degrowth among activist groups in the South
  - Semantic controversies: denying the opponent actually legitimises it
  - Other language is suggested: redistribution; appropriate use of welfare…
- Eurocentric thinking (again!)	
  - Western/high-income countries centred approach -> individualistic
  - Aversion to standardising principles that undermine the flourishing of local initiatives
- Not radical enough	
  - Degrowth proposals seem to accommodate stances within the boundaries of the system (not shared perspective!): is degrowth anti-capitalist?
  - Why not move the discourse towards other terms such as eco-socialism, re-commoning, Nature-centred perspective?

2. Learning: organizational learning practices (developing and distributing knowledge)
  - formal and informal learning practices help organizations to develop unique resources enabling them to be competitive
3. Technology: the use of technology (applying knowledge)

- the knowledge intensification of the economy affects all organizations

Electricity and information technology (IT) probably are the two most important GPTs so far. We analyze how the U.S. economy reacted to them. We date the Electrification era from 1894 until 1930, and the IT era from 1971 until the present. While we document some differences between the two technologies, we follow David [In: Technology and Productivity: The Challenge for Economic Policy (1991) 315-347] and emphasize their similarities. Our main findings are: 1.Productivity growth in the two GPT eras tended to be lower than it was in other periods, with productivity slowdowns taking place at the start of the two eras and the IT era slowdown stronger than that seen during Electrification.2.Both GPTs were widely adopted, but electricity's adoption was faster and more uniform over sectors.3.Both improved as they were adopted, but measured by its relative price decline, IT has shown a much faster improvement than Electricity did.4.Both have spawned innovation, but here, too, IT dominates Electricity in terms of the number of patents and trademarks issued.5.Both were accompanied by a rise in “creative destruction” and turbulence as measured by the entry and exit of firms, by mergers and takeovers, and by changing valuations on the stock exchange. In sum, Electrification spread faster than IT has been spreading, and it did so more evenly and broadly over sectors. Also, IT comprises a smaller fraction of the physical capital stock than electrified machinery did at its corresponding stage. On the other hand, IT seems to be technologically more dynamic; the ongoing spread of IT and its continuing precipitous price decline are reasons for optimism about productivity growth in the 21st century.},
  comment          = {Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1996) argue that a GPT should have the following three characteristics:
1. Pervasiveness - The GPT should spread to most sectors.
2. Improvement - The GPT should get better over time and, hence, should keep lowering the costs of its users.
3. Innovation spawning - The GPT should make it easier to invent and produce new products or processes.

Paper compares the Electrification and IT eras

May be worth returning to to consider how plausable a general model of technological revolutions is

  comment          = {older view is that economic fluctuations are caused by endogenous factors, then that they are cause by exogenous forces. This book is largely in agreement with the latter but notes some endogenous effects such as sings of confidence



Considers the last 5 major recessions (1920-21, 1929-32, 1973-75, 1979-82 and 1989-93) and looks at evidence for:
(a) the reaction to a shock of consumers - largely about prospects and optimism in terms of consumption, dept creation and dept repayment. Identifies that confidence is not necessarily in line with economic fluctuations since consumer will carry past experience forward. Finds that `expections' assumes more clarity of the future than most comsumers have.
(b) the reaction of business - investments are in response to confidence and can have an amplifying (sometimes stabilising) effect on output fluctuations meaning that stock changes contributed to almost all recessions
(c) the reaction of the whole system - ``Consumers' behaviour and firms' investment behaviour together determine the economy's response to shocks, and go far to determine macro fluctuations.''

``In all major recessions, fixed investment was heavily affected and in most cases constituted a fair share of the recession (e.g. a quarter). In two cases (1973 and 1979) this was in part the result of contractionary monetary policy. In all cases it probably reflected also a lessening of confidence induced by the fall in output. Loss of confidence evidently also affected consumer spending in some cases. Thus, changes in mood seem to have been a factor in all major recessions.''

Section 12.2 deals with general questions about the instruments of economic policy; despite the waves of deconstruction that are generally taken to have destroyed the intellectual foundations for a Keynesian fiscal policy, the author sees a theoretical case for it--along with severe practical limits that stem from the reactions of financial markets to government borrowing; the section goes on to discuss the effect and role of monetary policy.

Several opportunities for fruitful integration of alternative streams of economics research—Evolutionary, Structuralist and Keynesian in particular—have been also missed. Even the humanist approaches to development, such as Sen's Human Capability Approach, paid little attention to the domain of production. In this article, we argue that the fragmentation of the production-centred paradigm has weakened both academic research and policy-making related to economic development. We introduce and discuss eight articles developed around the special issue theme of Bringing Production Back into Development. We argue that a renewed `productionist' agenda is essential to address the structural challenges faced by developing countries, even more so after the revelation of structural weaknesses by the pandemic.},

  comment          = {Critiques current view of development which is a combination of Neoclassical (NC) (from after WWII) with Amartya Sen's Capability Approach (CA) (from 1980s). 

Whilst production was fundamental to classical ideas about development, NC became increasing fixated on markets resulting in:
1. production is a black box
2. technological and organisation learning in production is  barely considered
3. assumptions that production is homogeneous
4. economy is framed as transaction between individuals (atomistic assumption)
5. bias towards consumption

CA criticised NC but remained:
1. individualistic, neglecting the collective dimensions of the economy
2. focused on consumption being key to human welfare, neglecting the role of production (e.g. that a job is about more than earning to consume)

Result is neglect of full and productive employment as a critical dimension of development

By focussing on markets rather than production, economic consequences could include undermining the innovative effects of large organisations if policies implemented to correct monopolies without descretion

By considering production homogeneous, policies are applied across whole economy rather than providing selective supports

The atomistic assumption neglects behaviour inside organisations and their collective nature

Pro-consumer (rather than producer) (a bit like Say's Law) leads to policies to alleviate poverty rather than un/under-employment

Proposes New Developmentalist Perspective

* Recognise the ``inevitably collective nature of the production process''
* ``Productive structures are ecomplex social organisations''
* transformation of production will transform institutions, society and ideology
* Production is heterogeneous inputs, outputs, firms, production units
* Physical effort may be reduced, intellectual effort increased

Looks at Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
* Undervaluing of production

``point out the critical need to understand the trade-offs between different sustainability dimensions—social, environmental and economic—and the need to reconcile them in a way that allows developing countries to transform their production structure and create good employment.''},

Another easy read from Chang!

NL `unholy' alliance between neoclassical (NC) (analytical tools) and Austrian-libertarian (political and moral philosophy)

State cannot be assumed to be impartial, onmipotent social guardian but self-seeking politicians under pressure from interest groups leads to government failures

NL absorbed welfare economics as it was `non-commital' (unlike Keynesianism) and and found ways to avoid state intervention such as minimising the state, prioritising entrepreneurship and finding interventionist policy too difficicult or dangerous

I understand that NC was still dominant in academia but NL in politics - not sure if NL ever really existed in academia?

NL has limitations that are rarely interrogated:
* foundation of free-market is flawed, all markets are regulated e.g. child labour is illegal
* market failures exist but are inconsistenly understood/defined. Failures of the market (e.g. inequality) are irrelevant in NC economics. Also a perfect market to NC is a non-competitive market failure in Schumpeterian economics (because innovations are immediately dissipated destroying the incentives for entrapreneurship. Markets are only. Instead says that institutional economics sees markets as one of many institutions of the capitalist economy
* despite definitive counter-evidence, NL tends to assume that markets came before states. And yet evidence is that states have both created and shaped markets.
* NL see markets as non-political but they demonstrably are: rights, wages, standards, entitlements, immigration control - all have political dimension

IPE is not New Institutionalist Economics but founded on work of Marx, Veblen, Schumpter, Polanyi and others

Includes acceptance that human motivations are varied, complexly interacting and institutions play a role in this

Theoretical demonstrations of how individuals welfare is not maximised by government, collective choice is inefficient.

``Public choice includes both `methodological individualism' and `rational choice', directly from economic theory to the analysis of politics. At one level of abstraction, these two elements are themselves relatively empty of empirical content. To model the behavior of persons, whether in markets or in politics, as maximizing utilities, and as behaving rationally in so doing, does not require specification of the arguments in utility functions. Economists go further than this initial step, however, when they identify and place arguments into the categories of `goods' and `bads'. Persons are then modeled as acting so as to maximize some index of `goods' and to minimize some index of `bads'.'' - provides some justification for this approach.

Change in opinion towards belief that high rewards were needed to provide incentives and drive productivity and that mobility meant people would not get stuck even if tail of the income distribution were getting bigger (aka increasing inequality)

Until 1970s, governments were assumed to be concerned with maximising social welfare and to have all the information they needed

oil crisis (1973-4) (major supply shock), depression, inflation, unemployment - all as Friedman predicted and Keynsian theory could not account for

Regulation was seen as creating perverse incentives and distorting resource allocation

Work on Public Choice Theory in 1960s developed ideas around government optimising social welfare function with assumptions that state is inefficient and state actors are motivated by their own ends

competition introduced into the electricity and gas

Hayek has earlier (1930s) critiqued socialism.

Public Choice Theory and Hayek were theoretical but real-world experience of stated owned enterprises and regulating the private sector seemed to bare out thesee ideas

Nordhaus1975 model of the manipulation of policy to maximise chances of reelection by myopic voters

In 1950s and 60s ideas included selective industrialisation and protection and import substiution to develop. In 1970s interst turned to the application of standard economics based on utility and profit maximisation. in the 1980s emphasis on fiscal discipline and market liberalisation latbelled as Washington Consensus in 1990 by John Williamson.

As an alternative to Marxism, rational choice liberalism had three broad elements:
- self-interested rational actor
- set-theoretic and axiomatic treatment of human rationality
- commitment to univrsal and objective scientific law

Keynes, Toynbee, Russell, Spengler, Eliot and Schumpeter had all argued that capitalism would collapse.


Think tanks played a huge role in spreading ideas and influencing politicians, some wanting to avoid socialism that would result from capitalisms collapse, also looking to counter how ideas from the liberal (left) Brookings Institution were entering policy and counter the New Deal coalition. Influenced Thatcher and Reagan: including RAND Corporation, Mont Pelerin Society and Institute of Economic Affairs

Univerisities and instiutional organisations also played a part: University of Chicago (Friedman), Public Choice Society, Thomas Jerfferson Center, Center for Study of Public Choice, (New York University, George Mason and Auburn) (``Austrians'')

In the 1980s IMF became involved in more than providing short-term loads, negotiating credit packages. World Bank made loads with conditions of liberalising economies.

Notes that initiaties are result of wealthy individuals funding research and promotion

Moreover, the very nature of economics, despite ideas that for example using mathematics protects it from ideology, is subject to value judgements including the nature of mathematics chosen.

Rather than a market economy, we have an organisational economy. However the boundary between markets and organisations is blurred, and varies with society within which the markets and organisations sit

In employees utility function, work is usually considered to have negative utility (loafing/shirking has positive utility). Neoclassical economics says that it's the contract that motivates the employee to accept authority and leaves the utility function open to be specified. However this doesn't stack up - many employees go beyond contact and contracts are usually ``incomplete''

``New institutional economics and related approaches are acts of faith, out perhaps piety''

Firm size and number has Pareto distribution - this didn't match ideas of optimum firm size but does indicate a probabilistic mechanism

There is a gap between ownership and control, goals of owners - profit, goals of managers - career status, wealth, quiet life

New institutional economics finds that employment achieves great savings on transaction costs

Factors in organisations:
- Rewards as motivators - these are difficult to specify especially in roles with a great deal of interdependence and evidence is that rewards alone have limited motivational effect
 - Loyalty and identification with organisational goals - discussion of `docility' and how it leads to altruism and positive outcomes for organisations that cultivate loyalty and [I guess what we now call engagement]
- Coordination - probably emerges out of necessities it at least efficiencies and allows actors to form more stable expectations. Coordination probably has wholly economic motivations and rewards when it is between organisations but within them it combats externalities

Note Devons' point that if markets had a simplifying effect, why is it we turn to central planning on complex situations such as war

  abstract         = {Controversy over EU-wide biofuel policy resonated within the UK, fuelling policy disagreements among UK public authorities. They disagreed over how to protect a space for future second-generation biofuels, which were expected to overcome harm from first-generation biofuels. The UK government defended rising targets for available biofuels as a necessary stimulus for industry to help fulfil the UK's EU obligations and eventually develop second-generation biofuels. By contrast, Parliamentary Select Committees opposed biofuel targets on grounds that these would instead lock-in first-generation biofuels, thus delaying or pre-empting second-generation biofuels. Those disagreements can be explained by different institutional responsibilities and reputational stakes towards `promise-requirement cycles', whereby techno-optimistic promises generate future requirements for the actors involved. The UK government's stance illustrates a `policy-promise lock-in', a dilemma whereby promised support is a requirement for credibility towards technology innovators and thus technoscientific development - but may delay the redirection of support from incumbent to preferable emerging technologies. Thus the sociology of expectations - previously applied to technological expectations from technology innovators - can be extended to analyse public authorities.},

Interesting questions raised over setting policy that is stable enough to build confidence and stimulate innovation and yet flexible enough to avoid ``policy-promise lock-in'' if problems arise with early stage developments that arise from policy.

``Promises and diffuse scenarios are used to convince funding organisations to invest money and attract other practitioners to join the development (Geels and Smit, 2000: 881). Technology innovators may exaggerate their promises''


November 2001 the European Commission had started formal negotiations on an EU Directive on Biofuels (EC, 2001), which became law in May 2003 (EU, 2003)

July 2002 the UK government introduced the first financial incentive: a fuel duty discount only for biodiesel (20p per litre)

2003 Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)3 published an Energy White Paper considered biofuels as an “important potential route for achieving the goal of zero-carbon transport, creating new opportunities for agriculture in the UK as well as globally” (DTI, 2003: 69). This was a policy change from previous focus on hydrogen fuel.

Later in 2003 the European Commission issued the first EU Biofuels Directive, initiating an EU-wide biofuel policy (EU, 2003). The Directive set non-binding “reference” targets through 2010, requiring increasing proportions of all diesel and petrol sold in Member States to be biofuels

In 2003 Parliament's Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee (EFRAC) acknowledged lack of knowledge on impacts and recommended the development of an auditing system on biofuels' environmental and socio-economic impacts in producer countries which UK gov doubted would be practically feasible

2005: UK government announcing future implementation of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), whose mandatory targets started incentivising biofuel production from 2008 onwards but, owing to uncertainty about benefits RTFO's mandatory targets were more cautious than the EU's higher reference target of 5.75\% per energy content6 by 2010

2006-7 NGOs turned against biofuels - first-generation biofuels were widely recognised as environmentally and socio-economically problematic - and called for a policy moratorium

Gallagher Review 2008 [official enquiry on biofuels] acknowledged drawbacks of biofuels but rejected the idea of a moratorium because this would damage investment in biofuels

This led to a slow-down UK biofuel targets in 2009 and increased R\&D funding for second generation biofuels.

https://doi.org/10.1068/c09206j argued that biofuel advocates “successfully transplanted their ecomodernist discourse into policy makers' consciousness and vocabularies” saying that the advocates' discourse had “superior appeal” compared to biofuel critics.

By 2008 UK targets were explicitly defended as `cautious' in response to high-profile calls for a moratorium, and were eventually delayed in 2009. This caution relates to the risk of locking in a nascent industry for first-generation biofuels, which the UK government initially presented as environmentally and socio-economically risky and excessively expensive (EFRAC, 2004gr: 6; HM Govt, 2004: 2).

- interest rates cuts
- liquidity provision

by US Federal Reserve, lender of last resort in time of crisis

mid-2008, financial crisis bleeding into US economy. Job growth turned sharply negative. 

Minsky's financial instability hypothesis is that during a boom, private actors (households, banks, etc) take on debt. During a 'bust' they tighten their belts and pay down debt.

Keynes identified that the spending multiplier works in reverse - a diminution in aggregate spending causes even less spending

However, with a large enough state, there is an automatic balance - tax will decline and draws on the welfare state will increase, creating a government deficit (not because of decisions by the current administration)

Traditional to think of government deficits as something that requires borrowing  which takes resources from savers and crowds out other economic activity

Instead, it should be seen as a flow of funds that increases the stock of net financial assets to the non-government sector

NC economics states that, on observing a fiscal deficit, private sector agents will anticipate a rise in taxes and therefore will save rather than spend

Great narrative of the aftermath of 2008 financial crisis especially in Eurozone also US and UK

Policies to improve the human condition should be evaluated on their social and economic outcomes rather than on narrow budget considerations

Estate taxation had been introduced in response to threat and actual war, then repealed, repeatedly but had stayed in place after WWI. It was reduced in response to budget surpluses. This was part of redistribution of wealth although was hotly debated and fluctuated for some years. In 1920s there was a battle over estate taxation - whether to raise/broaden or lower it

Revenue Act of 1932 in response to falling revenue after 1929 stock market crash, with increased taxation provisions was to address deficit as congress was agreed that this budget needed balancing to aid recovery. However, it did not include any borrowing despite some arguing for this.

This act had no expiration date - possibly an error or a `slight of hand'

``estate tax rates were increased as a means of generating additional revenue and preserving the nation's credit rating,11 while a gift tax was enacted to prevent wealthy taxpayers from circumventing the estate tax by making intervivos gifts''},

  comment          = {I found this astonishing - an insight into why public sector is treated with such disdain. Basically, if you thought that market actors were self-interested, wait til you see what motivates government actors and bureaucrats, who have been captured by interest groups. As a consequence, we need to subject all government actors to competition to ensure scrutiny and remove opportunity for acting in their own self interest. Supplies almost no empirical evidence.

Its very difficult not to read this as a treatise from a group that want to own most of the state.

Public choice scholars `pointed out' that the people who make public decision are just as self-interested as anyone else

Political parties have very strong objective to get elected

Buchanan and Tullock saw the political system as a process by which individuals seek to protect their own interests rather than strive to achieve some public interest...the real problem was government failure, monopoies, externalities and limited or one-sided information were much more evident in government than markets

Lobby groups are successful at winning concessions but they don't represent consumers because consumers have a wider set of concerns and are more numerous and thus harder to organise. A reason that consuders don't get involved in lobbying is that they can see someone else doing it and thus they free-ride the benefits.

Government may be employed to do important things that the market does not deliver (well)

``the problems that government intervention creates can be even more damanging than those it is intended to correct''

Elections are a problem because different outcomes can occur depending on the system employed. Also, voters tend to not express their true beliefs because, for instance, they vote tactically. Another problem is that elections are very infrequent whereas markets are constantly adjusting.

The general public have little motivation to put much effort into public debate. They are rationally ignorant, since they can influence things very little. It is not obvious why they bother to vote.

Public activities are not paid for my tax but rather a debt to be paid by future generations

Political parties choose policies because they think they will win not because they think they are right

Logrolling is always happening whereby multiple policies are put in together in order to get agreement from otherwise opposing sides

Rent seeking occurs when government give themselves monopolies over the provision of services. This ``massively distorts'' public decisions, markets and reduces competition and benefits certain groups.

Bureaucrats are motivated by the size of their budgets and are not exposed to the scrutiny of well-informed customers (unlike business people). There is a threat that bureaucrats will humble their political masters by leaking damaging information.

``so much state spending has been captured by special interest groups''

So we also have democratic failure as well as government failure!

  abstract         = {Objective Since 2010, England has experienced relative constraints in public expenditure on healthcare (PEH) and social care (PES). We sought to determine whether these constraints have affected mortality rates.Methods We collected data on health and social care resources and finances for England from 2001 to 2014. Time trend analyses were conducted to compare the actual mortality rates in 2011{\textendash}2014 with the counterfactual rates expected based on trends before spending constraints. Fixed-effects regression analyses were conducted using annual data on PES and PEH with mortality as the outcome, with further adjustments for macroeconomic factors and resources. Analyses were stratified by age group, place of death and lower-tier local authority (n=325). Mortality rates to 2020 were projected based on recent trends.Results Spending constraints between 2010 and 2014 were associated with an estimated 45 368 (95\% CI 34 530 to 56 206) higher than expected number of deaths compared with pre-2010 trends. Deaths in those aged >=60 and in care homes accounted for the majority. PES was more strongly linked with care home and home mortality than PEH, with each {\textsterling}10 per capita decline in real PES associated with an increase of 5.10 (3.65{\textendash}6.54) (p\&lt;0.001) care home deaths per 100 000. These associations persisted in lag analyses and after adjustment for macroeconomic factors. Furthermore, we found that changes in real PES per capita may be linked to mortality mostly via changes in nurse numbers. Projections to 2020 based on 2009-2014 trend was cumulatively linked to an estimated 152 141 (95\% CI 134 597 and 169 685) additional deaths.Conclusions Spending constraints, especially PES, are associated with a substantial mortality gap. We suggest that spending should be targeted on improving care delivered in care homes and at home; and maintaining or increasing nurse numbers.},

Key messages
The UK has an important international leadership role to play in driving global implementation, underpinned by action at home:

* Defining the UK's role. The delayed 2030 Strategic Framework (the Government's vision for the UK's long-term international role tackling climate change and biodiversity loss) is an opportunity to set out the UK's leadership role in helping the world achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
* Future COPs and UK diplomatic capability. After exiting the EU and convening COP26, the UK Government should decide what its priorities are in COP negotiations and communicate these at a high level. The relationships and capabilities built through the Presidency should be used to actively champion progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and take forward the delivery of pledges and initiatives.
* Mobilising finance. As a major finance centre and sponsor of the multilateral development banks, the UK should pay particular attention to its positions on mobilising finance, which are vital to global success on climate change, and how it contributes to future Just Energy Transition Partnerships.
* Delivering the UK's contributions to the Paris Agreement. The UK must implement its Net Zero Strategy to deliver its legislated domestic targets and international commitments. It must strengthen its response on climate adaptation, which remains weak, with an ambitious, action-oriented third National Adaptation Programme in 2023.},

The effect of income tax is to make the rich man act as a kind of agent working for society on commission. He receives only part of the return on the investment but he loses only a part of the money that is invested 

The corporation was devised, making it possible for many individuals to combine and undertake risky enterprises without one person having to risk all his fortune on one venture 

It is the fear of inflation which is the only rational basis for suspicion of the printing of money

One if the greatest deterrents to private investment is the fear that the depression will come before the investment has paid for itself 

The argument against deficit spending is answered with: 
1. The national debt does not have to keep on increasing
2. Even if the national debt does grow, the interest on it does not
have to be raised out of current taxes
3. Even if the interest on the debt is raised out of current taxes,
these taxes constitute only the interest on only a fraction of the
benefit enjoyed from the government spending, and are not lost
to the nation but are merely transferred from taxpayers to bond-
holders
4. High income taxes need not discourage investment, because
appropriate deductions for losses can diminish the capital actually
risked by the investor in the same proportion as his net income
from the investment is reduced.

Textbook economic theory holds that high levels of government debt make it more expensive for companies to borrow. But these days, interest rates are low, stock market prices are high relative to company earnings, and major companies hold large amounts of cash on their balance sheets. No one seriously argues that the cost of capital is holding back businesses from investing. Cutting the deficit, then, is unlikely to spur much private investment.''

``Higher levels of debt do have downsides. They could make it harder for governments to summon the political will to stimulate the economy in a downturn. But saying that a country would be better off with lower debt is not the same as saying that it would be better off lowering its debt. The risks associated with high debt levels are small relative to the harm cutting deficits would do.''

``There is a widely held misconception that the deficit has risen primarily because government programs have grown more generous. Not so. Deficits have ballooned because a series of tax cuts have dramatically reduced government revenue below past projections and historical levels. The tax cuts passed by Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump totaled three percent of gdp—much more than the projected increases in entitlement spending over the next 30 years.''

Advocates the ``do-no-harm approach'': focus on important investments but do no harm.

``Although the “optimal” size of government is not known, an accepted tenet of public finance is that beyond some level of revenue collection, the marginal net social costs - including the excess burden of taxation - of additional public expenditure increase more than proportionately with the additional taxation needed to finance spending. Against that background and given the current high level of public spending in many countries and the future spending pressures due to population ageing, the largest part of consolidation probably should consist of cuts in public spending. Since many countries rely on so-called tax expenditures for the pursuit of selected policy goals (e.g., home ownership), the reduction or elimination of base-eroding tax preferences will appear as revenue enhancements rather than spending cuts. In other cases where spending is low, there may be a case to put greater emphasis on revenue measures.''},

  comment          = {``The report argues that the dominant approach to economic policymaking over the last forty years, based on an orthodox and subsequently revised model of neoclassical economic theory, is not adequate to address these challenges''

`` In macroeconomic policy, the neoclassical framework encouraged a view that high levels of government debt `crowd out' private investment, so fiscal deficits should be limited, and monetary policy (adjustments to interest rates) should play the primary role in controlling inflation and managing overall demand''

``In the period before the financial crisis, this economic model (often described as the `Washington Consensus') was strongly influenced by a particular form of economic analysis. Based on an orthodox version of `neoclassical' economic theory, this assumed that the liberalisation of markets would generally improve their efficiency in allocating resources, and would therefore tend to optimise overall economic welfare. Although markets sometimes failed - for example in the presence of negative externalities, or in the provision of public goods - governments were also seen as prone to failure. They tended to have less information than market actors, and to be captured vested interests. So policy rooted in this kind of analysis tended to be sceptical of government intervention, with deregulation of various kinds widely favoured.''

``Over the last decade (and in some fields for longer) policy makers have modified some aspects of this analytical framework. Drawing on longstanding developments in academic economics, it has been acknowledged that orthodox neoclassical analysis has limitations: that liberalised markets are not always efficient and market failures can be significant.33 Policy makers have recognised the need for greater government intervention, in fields such as labour market, regional and environmental policy, as well as in monetary and financial policy. In many of these fields, and others, the OECD has supported these new analytical and policy developments.''},

Rational Expectations was an idea introduced in the early 1970s, again initially incompatible with NC synthesis. - perceived variations in availability led to changes in price

Then Real Business Cycles (RBC) are introduced which I believe (uses the word intertemporal a lot) assumes that decisions are made by economic actors on the basis of expectations about now and a time in the future.

``In the RBC model, changes in tax rates have a powerful effect on real activity'' 

Also talks about New-Keynesian, Second-Generation New Keynesian and Dynamic Price-Setting models but I've not read this

Finally, bringing all the above together creates the New Neoclassical Synthesis! Goes on to discuss the impact and role of monetary policy

``The models of the New Neoclassical Synthesis are complex since they
involve intertemporal optimization, rational expectations, monopolistic
competition, costly price adjustment and dynamic price setting, and an
important role for monetary policy''},

``Growing distrust in politicians should be of particular concern to democrats and progressives. A lack of trust matters for two main reasons. First, growing distrust can lead to a downwards spiral of democratic decline, with voters disengaging, becoming polarised, or turning to populist leaders and causes (Hooghe and Dassonneville 2018). Second, it matters for social progress: a lack of trust undermines the ability of government to intervene and deliver better policy outcomes (Hetherington 2006)''

Trust is determined by two main sets of factors. 
1. The performance of government
2. The processes of government

Argument between left and right over size of state boils down to:
a. whether we expect state actors to make poor decisions about allocation
b. whether we trust more the wisdom of people acting via democratic or via market-based processes

Very critical of neoliberal dominance - task of progressives is to convinced those not well served by NL that a different economic model may serve them better

Treasury is UK key institution for industry although the May government's establishment of Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) seems to be trying to take away some of Treasury's power. Treasury tends to be sceptical of targetted industrial policies for fear of failure and distorted markets.

Main view of Treasury is that industrial policy is for increasing productivity. However, core problem is reduced to extracting greater value from labour inputs and this leads to neoliberal policies

Thus need to identify `positive tipping points' or `sensitive intervention points' (See Hepburn)

Positive tipping points are intentional

Many theories including: social-technical / socio-technical  systems, social-ecological systems, transitions management, Multi-level perspective (Geels), leverage points...

Needs to happen faster than theory current suggests (i.e. >20 years)

Theory of how to tip a system includes concepts include forcing, enabling conditions, system features and control variables

``the key challenge in indentifying tipping points is thus to indentify the critical control variable(s) and features of a particular system''

Aspect of current conceptualisation of this system is that change is being triggered by agents external to the system, and does not capture endogenous evolution of the system

Tipping points often occur when there is a critical mass of individuals, although sometimes other factors occur. After ZeppiniFK2014 there are a range of models, which incorporate ideas like
* increasing returns
* learning by doing
* economies of scale
* technological reinforcement
* coordination tipping point - only occurs with mass coordination of individuals like for EV charging points
* informational cascades
* herding behaviour
* percolation threshold

Three phases to operationalising positive tipping points:
* identifying and creating enabling conditions
  * population size
  * social network structure
  * information/capability
  * price
  * performance/quality
  * desirability/symbolism
  * accessibility/convenience
  * complementarity
* Sensing the potential - e.g. 
  * workshops to identify tipping points
  * citizens' assemblies and juries
  * formalise mathematical model of change
  * agent-based modelling
  * changes in dynamical behaviour of system - e.g. reduced resilience whereby system takes longer to recover from perturbations, even possible early warning signs before past stock market bubbles

List *who* should drive the change, and *how*:
Social, technological, ecological innovations, policy interventions and public investment, private investment and markets, public information and behavioural nudges.

  comment          = {UK productivity has been flat since 2008 whereas in other countries it has risen some with more unemployment but not all

Reasons why advanced economies have face falling productivity growth relative to the post-war era may include:
* marginal costs for new knowledge generation
* waning of the IT revolution
* plateauing educational attainment (v student debt)
* aging population
* demand contractions

ICT has not been as important to increasing productivity as expected

London has very high productivity compared to other parts of UK, the interrgeional inequalities over such a short distance is exceptional in industrialised countries

Idea that growth would spread out from London [like a geographical trickle-down!]

Centralised government is inappropriate under these conditions and makes improving productivity in places other than London difficult

Talks about Local Enterprise Partnerships LRPs

There is a slow shift towards a more place-based logic

Gives a history of place-based thinking

World Bank tries to be `space-blind' but OECD-Barca report is placed based

Standard research funding model is space-blind

UKRI research could build on knowledge about place-based research and innovation by:
* establishment of baselines
* development of theory of change (see below)
* foresight analysis and modelling
* output and outcome indicators
* monitoring of policy outcomes
* interpretation of different outomces
* dissemination of learning and best-practise

Identifies that a theory of change needs outlining for each place that determines 
* policy inputs, outputs and outcomes
* diffusion processes and, dessemination mechanism
Also explicit use of established baselines

efficiency is inputs to outputs
effectiveness/impact is outputs to outcomes},

Of course, Brexit may have something to do with the UK's performance: the Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that the economy is already £50- 60 billion smaller than it would have been had the UK not voted to leave the EU, and that UK business investment growth is the lowest in the G7 (Emmerson et al.},

Between 2015 and 2018 the green economy grew at 5\% ayear (ONS report from 2018)

Green economy could provide good quality jobs e.g. 10,000 direct jobs in offshore wind could triple by 2030

Claim that ``the average UK manufacturer spends five times as much on resource costs as on labour...'' I'm not sure if this is the case but the reference given (later in the paragraph:  \url{https://green-alliance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lean_and_clean.pdf}) demonstrates that material costs are far more volatile than labour and they have been higher than labour costs in recent years

``...more scope to raise productivity via resource efficiency than by cutting labour costs''

However, government decisions are not supporting clean/green technology - e.g. Brexit making it harder to attract tech industry

Contrasts the strategy for off shore eind and EVs and finds the starting point similar but only wind got the long term support with deployment

``because circular economy activity, encompassing remanufacturing, recycling, servitisation and repair, is well-correlated to skill levels that have been hollowed out by mechanisation and globalisation, these jobs are likely to reduce structural, and not just cyclical, unemployment''

future-proofed economic growth that addresses inequality and support good quality jobs should use policy to drive change to zero emissions vehicles, drive innovation in energy efficiency, deploy modular factory-built building retrofits, invest in resource productivity and circular economy approaches to heavy industry},

  comment          = {Heavily referenced in LentonEtAl2022

Considers 7 models of technological transition:
* hyperselection (Bruckner et al 1996)
* adoption (Arthur 1989)
* coordination game (a class of economic models of strategic interaction)
* information cascades (Banerjee 1992 and Bikhchandani et al 1992)
* co-evolution (technologies are often composed of components that interact in complex ways to produce particular functionalities)
* percolation (diffusion through society, e.g. word of mouth)
* social influence (e.g. Granovetter 1978)

Most, but not all, models follow economic assumption of utility maximisation

The same phenomenon of a technological transition can be explained by very different underlying logics e.g. prices, recommendations, expectations and mimicking

Mentions Geels's work as being evolutionary which is at odds with the typical revolutionary framing of two competing technologies

These models should be considered canonical and as building blocks. Contextual factors would be needed to specify the framework for evaluation in any given context},

A technological revolution comprises a cluster of technology, low cost input of energy, rapid transport and communications p8

Each technology has potential in all economic activities p8

Compares with Kuznets's Epochal Innovations p9

In constrast to technological revolution, techno-economic paradigms (Chapter 2 section C) includes much more intangible ideas such as common sense, principles, best practise, standards, the way organisations are structured, [I understand this to be those things that are obvious to those living within the paradigm that would not have been obvious beforehand]

Organisations change to enable the new paradigm: hierarchies were good for previous paradigms where information needed to flow from top but they are now rigid and clumsy p17-19

Instead a decentralised organisation with a strategy core is more flexible and networked p19

See references to Castells chapters for more information on social, cultural, economic and political, and including organisational impacts of change of paradigm p19

As the paradigm shifts there will be an accumulation and installation in new direction and disaccumulation and uninstallation from the old direction p20

Society is shaped by and shapes the revolution p22

The history of the understanding of `creative distruction' p22

`great surges of development' p23

Changes occur initially by demands of the changing economy and then the needs resulting from the consequent turbulence p25

There is likely to be a loss of jobs, skills and geographical displacement, social unrest, the collapse of social adaptability ultimate lead to an acceptance of `common sense' p26-7

It can be difficult to vision the future potential from the new technology - examples of people in the past who could (e.g. Alexander Graham Bell, who had difficulty being understood) and couldn't (e.g. Eddison and the boss of IBM)

The exhaustion of the old paradigm creates a need for radical entrapreneurship and also creates idle capital to invest p33

Once design, product and profit is visible, engineers, designers and entrepreneurs will be fired to innovate in the new trajectory p34

There is a list of tensions on p39

Fitting Hitler and Roosevelt into the model p41

Installation period: tense coexistence of two paradigms p43

At the end: evolutions begin to wain p45-6

Not a straight jacket for history - a heurstic device P49

Phases:
* Irruption - Old models not working meanwhile new entrepreneurs, new ideas, successful behaviors p49-50 
* Frenzy - Rich getting richer. Veblen \& Engels Migrations. Productivity explosion. Regulation seen as hindering. Individualism p50-52
* Turning Point - Collective wellbeing. Regulation needed p52-53
* Synergy - Labour Laws, Full employment (as near as) redistribution. Middle class. Financial capital directly tied to production p53-54
* Maturity - Meadows Limits to Growth Report. signs of prosperity but broken promises. workers protests. Protests of marginalised p54-56

The current surge, forming the Age of Information and Telecommunications, began in 1971 with the creation of the microprocessor. This Irrupted into previous surge which has formed the Age of Oil, the Automobile and Mass Production which is considered to have started around 1908 when the Model-T rolled off the production line

  abstract         = {A visit to a physician these days is cold: physicians spend most of their time typing at computers, making minimal eye contact. Appointments generally last only a few minutes, with scarce time for the doctor to connect to a patient's story, or explain how and why different procedures and treatments might be undertaken. As a result, errors abound: indeed, misdiagnosis is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States, trailing only heart disease, cancer, and stroke. This is because, despite having access to more resources than ever, doctors are vulnerable not just to the economic demand to see more patients, but to distraction, burnout, data overload, and their own intrinsic biases. Physicians are simply overmatched.

As Eric Topol argues in Deep Medicine, artificial intelligence can help. Natural-language processing could automatically record notes from our doctor visits; virtual psychiatrists could better predict the risk of suicide or other mental health issues for vulnerable patients; deep-learning software will make every physician a master diagnostician; and we could even use smartphone apps to take our own medical "selfies" for skin exams and receive immediate analysis. . On top of that, the virtual smartphone assistants of today--Alexa, Siri, Cortana--could analyze our daily health data to reduce the need for doctor visits and trips to the emergency room, and support for people suffering from asthma, epilepsy, and heart disease. By integrating tools like these into their daily medical practice, doctors would be able to spend less time collecting and cataloging information, and more time providing thorough, intimate, and meaningful care for their patients, as no machine can.

Artificial intelligence can also help remedy the debilitating cost of healthcare, both for individuals and the economy writ large. The medical sector now absorbs 20 percent of the US gross domestic product--it is largest sector by dollars and jobs. And it's very inefficient. Take the cost of medical scans: There are over 20 million medical scans performed in the US every day, and an MRI, for example, costs hundreds to thousands of dollars. AI could process 260 million medical scans (more than 2 weeks' worth) in less than 24 hours for a cost of only $1000. We pay billions and billions of dollars for the same work today.

The American health care system needs a serious reboot, and artificial intelligence is just the thing to press the restart button. As innovative as it is hopeful, Deep Medicine ultimately shows us how we can leverage artificial intelligence for better care at lower costs with more empathy, for the benefit of patients and physicians alike.},

Although a third of Earth's largest groundwater basins are being depleted by irrigated agriculture2, little is known about the conditions that lead resource users to comply with conservation policies. Here we developed an agent-based model3,4of irrigated agriculture rooted in principles of cooperation5,6and collective action7and grounded on the World Values Survey Wave 6 (n = 90,350). Simulations of three major aquifer systems facing unsustainable demands reveal tipping points where social norms towards groundwater conservation shift abruptly with small changes in cultural values and monitoring and enforcement provisions. These tipping points are amplified by group size and best invoked by engaging a minority of rule followers. Overall, we present a powerful tool for evaluating the contingency of regulatory compliance upon cultural, socioeconomic, institutional and physical conditions, and its susceptibility to change beyond thresholds. Managing these thresholds may help to avoid unsustainable groundwater development, reduce enforcement costs, better account for cultural diversity in transboundary aquifer management and increase community resilience to changes in regional climate. Although we focus on groundwater, our methods and findings apply broadly to other resource management issues.},

* Republican Rome: Conflict of the Orders (494-287 BCE)
* England: Chartist Movement: 1819-1867 CE
* Russia: Reform Period: 1855-1881 CE
* USA: Progressive Era: 1914-1939 CE

Looks at each of these in detail

Two different conclusions can be drawn from these periods
First that they were preceded by periods of land expansion which meant that wealth could be extracted and people exported 
Second that institutional reform restored popular wellbeing in all four cases

``The cases explored here suggest some possible answers. It appears incumbent on those with the greatest access to power, wealth, and authority to `future think' and recognize the signs of unrest early on. Crucially, elites must be willing to give up some private gains for the public good, for example through supporting welfare programs or promoting redistribution of wealth and labour autonomy to the working classes''},

  comment          = {Consideres technological revolutions specifically from the innovation perspective, after Schumpeter, because it is innovation rather than invention that is of interest to markets and thus results in meaningful change.

Radical innovations are improved on by incremental innovations

Innovation doesn't happen in isolation, there are many agents of change in the collective process: suppliers, distributors and many others, including consumers. 

Radical innovations stimulate the growth of whole industries - and technology systems. These modify business, institutions and culture and require rules and regulations. Ultimately, these adaptations shape the technology itself

Goes on to discuss the 5 Technological Revolutions

Great surges of development break with Kondratiev's and Schumpeter's notion of Long Waves

From Perez 1983 finds 3 different types of core industry in the revolution:
* motive - what is cheap (semiconductors, oil, steel, coal, water power)
* carrier - products of the revolution (h/w and s/w, cars and appliances, steel shops, iron machines, textile machines)
* infrastructure - (internet, roads and electricity, world transport, transcontinental railways and steamship routes and ports, national railways and canals)

Discusses the techno-economic or meta- paradigm - emergin heuristic routines and approaches, changes in cost structure. 

Lots of examples from each surge

Also, changes beyond the economy - suburbanisation, globalisation. Discusses organisational changes need to enable flexible networked increasingly global operationsIZ*.  but there is inertia: ``The operations manuals and hierarchical structures of government ministries in the 1960s were fundamentally similar to those of a big mass production corporation. Yet, at present, these two sorts of institutions are very different.''

``On the view being described here, the notions of long run equilibrium and continuous progress are rejected in favour of more complex processes of overcoming multiple disequilibria originated in massive innovation, in internal differentiation within and between sectors, of creative destruction, assimilation, learning and unlearning successive technological spaces and best practice models and of reaching and overcoming maturity through successive surges of change.''

IZ* [I misunderstood this section but it makes me realise that this isn't described in Perez's account: Markets and competition, which were common place in the private sector entered into the public sector Public Choice Theory and New Public Management]},

  comment          = {Contrasts mission-oriented innovation policies with diffusion oriented approaches for the new Scottish National Investment Bank SNIB. (\cite{Freeman1995} goes into this distinction). Finds that the mission oriented approach applied to this bank ``constitutes 'fuzzy' policy making which is highly opaque lacking sufficient detail and fails to align itself properly with the demand conditions within the Scottish innovation system''. Suggest some version of diffusion-oriented policies would work better up to include hybrid and generating breakthrough innovation firms.

According to Mazzucato and Penna, state investment banks have three roles: counter-cyclical capital development and new venture support

Is paper asks ``are mission oriented innovation policies sufficiently nuanced to assist policymakers in the operational and strategic deployment of new policy instruments such as the SNIB?''

``Mission-oriented countries often heavily prioritise a highly linear [science and technology approach to innovation] STI view of innovation (Jensen at al 2007)''

Diffusion oriented approach ... ``is more experimental interactive va and relational towards innovation ... knowledge arise from doing, using and interacting (DUI)''

Garudand Karnøe 2003 vividly demonstrate the differences between gui and STI breakthrough approaches towards innovation in their study of Danish and US wind turbine industry. In Denmark there was less emphasis on developing dramatic solutions instead strong networks of actors gradually built up their technological competencies. In us the focus was on producing radically new Hi-Tec lightweight and high-speed turbines. Denmark prevailed.

Identifies that diffusion oriented approaches often have local embeddedness local orientation and this discourages blue skies research and precludes getting involved in the creation of startups.

Considers:
* types of mission
* types of innovation
* types of instruments

Missions:
Goes into some detail pretty king blueprint for the bank identifying that these are rather high-level and don't offer practical mechanism for achieving the objectives. Highlights concerns about the risk of `policy capture', `agency problems', `implementation failures' and the fact that the bank aims to make a positive financial return could mean it becomes risk-averse.

Criticises the advice that policymakers should pick the problem not the sector by saying that ``selecting missions may have unintended consequences of preferentially benefiting certain sectors over others which goes against the banks principal of supporting firms `whatever sector they appear' ''

Innovation:
Identify that much research in Scotland occurs in universities and very little in the SME sector. High-tech SMEs constitute a very small part of the business population. Suggest that the focus on high growth firms could damage the non-high tech SME sector. A note that the unpredictable nature of firm growth some suggest it's random.

Instruments:
Find that there has only been a partial assessment of funding gaps and goes into more detail about funding approaches

According to Haldane (2018, 7) the UK does R well but D poorly where the refers to development that the diffusion and dissemination of innovation. 

The diffusion oriented approach they suggest is is similar to a strategy undertaken by countries such as Israel via their Yozma Fund.

Also See Freeman1995 for discussion of ST(I) - linear - approach  compared to (DUI) diffusion - approach which emerged in the 50s and 60s. Also Lundvall2007, Martin2016.},

  abstract         = {The traditional “one size fits all” education system has been largely criticized in recent years on the ground of its lacking the capacity to meet individual student needs. Global education systems are leaning towards a more personalized, student-centered approach. Innovations like Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have given the modern-day technology to accommodate the distinctive features of human beings - smart machines and computers have been built to understand individual-specific needs. This opens an avenue for “personalization” in the education sector. From, mushrooming of Education Technology (EdTech) start-ups to government funding in AI research, it is evident that the next generation educational reforms would take a quantum leap forward piloted by Big Data analysis and AI. The objective of this paper is to organize the vast literature on the use of AI for personalization of education and to shed light on the key themes by which an AI-driven approach makes structural modifications to the existing education system. To this effect, the paper employed a systematic review using a Human-In-The-Loop natural language processing model of past two years' literature (2019-2021) in English language from IEEE Xplore on countries China, India and the USA. This process yielded more than 2000 search results at first and these were eventually shortlisted to 353 relevant papers for in-depth analysis. Being the pioneers in EdTech innovations, insights from research done in these three countries provides valuable input for the development of global education systems and research. The findings bring forward AI's success in catering to specific learning requirements, learning habits, and learning abilities of students and guiding them into optimized learning paths across all three countries. Not just that, it is also evident from the literature that AI augments educational content, customizes it for any individual according to their needs, and raises the flag of caution for anticipated learning difficulties. This recalibrates the role of instructors as well as optimizes the teaching-learning environment for a better learning experience. The upward trajectory of educational development with AI opens a new horizon of personalized education for the future generation, but also comes with its challenges. Data privacy issues, availability of digital resources, and affordability constraints have been reported in the recent literature as impediments in the way of promoting such technologies for day-to-day practice.},

In addition, we introduce cutting-edge simultaneous translation methods that achieve a balance between translation quality and latency. We then describe various products and applications of machine translation. At the end of this article, we briefly discuss challenges and future research directions in this field.},

  abstract         = {The Circular Economy concept aims to ensure environmental sustainability through the recovery of durable products that have reached the end of their useable life. Recovery strategies such as remanufacturing enable durable parts and cores to be restored to their original functionality and performance, thereby minimising the consumption of virgin materials and energy required for the production of new parts and components. To date, the repair and restoration processes concerning those parts and cores that can be remanufactured involved conventional methods such as material overlay and welding. These conventional methods are highly dependent on skilled manual labour or specialised industrial robots. With the notable growth in the global remanufacturing industry, it is imperative to deploy highly-efficient and sustainable methods to automate repair and restoration. Recent trends in remanufacturing repair and restoration indicate an increasing interest in metal additive manufacturing technology. To enhance the additive manufacturing efficiency for automated repair and restoration, it is crucial to optimise the core design. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative outline of remanufacturing repair and restoration, using both conventional and automated methods. This paper also presents and discusses comprehensive insight into the application of AI-based techniques for design optimisation specific to additive manufacturing repair. Component design optimisation is crucial due to its impact on process efficiency and the life cycle of components. The review indicates that, despite the increasing interest in using additive manufacturing for repair and restoration, reports on the application of AI for design optimisation specific to repair and restoration using additive manufacturing remain limited. Furthermore, there are no established guidelines concerning design for repair and restoration using additive manufacturing. The paper concludes with recommendations for further research and presents a future outlook on AI-based optimisation for component design to facilitate repair and restoration using additive manufacturing. Automation is expected to facilitate the removal of roadblocks specific to process inefficiency and human limitations during conventional repair and restoration in remanufacturing.},

In practice, however, evaluations of ML models frequently focus on only a narrow range of decontextualized predictive behaviours. We examine the evaluation gaps between the idealized breadth of evaluation concerns and the observed narrow focus of actual evaluations. Through an empirical study of papers from recent high-profile conferences in the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities, we demonstrate a general focus on a handful of evaluation methods. By considering the metrics and test data distributions used in these methods, we draw attention to which properties of models are centered in the field, revealing the properties that are frequently neglected or sidelined during evaluation. By studying these properties, we demonstrate the machine learning discipline's implicit assumption of a range of commitments which have normative impacts; these include commitments to consequentialism, abstractability from context, the quantifiability of impacts, the limited role of model inputs in evaluation, and the equivalence of different failure modes. Shedding light on these assumptions enables us to question their appropriateness for ML system contexts, pointing the way towards more contextualized evaluation methodologies for robustly examining the trustworthiness of ML models.},

Two cases are presented — one from Brazil and one from Nigeria — where public officials play a major role. In Brazil, public officials actively encourage a high level of citizen input to the production of urban infrastructure. In Nigeria, public officials discourage citizen contributions to primary education. The third section of the paper provides a brief overview of the theory of coproduction and its relevance for understanding the two cases. The last section addresses the implications of coproduction in polycentric systems for synergy and development.},
  comment          = {``Coproduction implies that citizens can play an active role in producing public goods and services of consequence to them''

Example from Brazil whereby citizens were involved in digging and installing small feeder lines for water and sanitation which could then be linked into the lrager trunk lines. This meant it could be away from traffic and thus much cheaper and locals could continue to maintain the feeder lines.

Second example was various schools in Nigeria that had a range of states of repair, moral and students outcomes. ``When coproduction is discouraged by taking over schools that villagers had perceived as being ``their'' schools, by creating chaotic changes in who was responsible for funding and running a primary school system, and by top-down administrative command as the style for all decision making, only the most determined citizens will persist in coproductive activities.''},

  comment          = {Highlights: 

* The primary government response to England's housing affordability crisis is to build 300,000 new homes per year

* Using embodied and operational emissions models we estimate the government's business-as-usual housing strategy consumes England's whole cumulative carbon budget [1.5°C] by 2050

* Other strategies for meeting society's housing needs are theoretically possible, but they face a challenging political economy

* `Growth-dependencies' in the housing sector mean social welfare risks declining if house prices and construction rates fall

* Solutions include decarbonising the existing housing stock through rapid retrofitting, and policies disincentivising the overconsumption of floorspace


A super snappy summary of the state of housing stock with regard to climate and biodiversity.

``Government household and housing stock data show that the UK has a surplus of dwellings relative to households (Fig. 1). This surplus has grown from 660,000-1.23 million homes from 1996 to 2019 (Mulheirn, 2019)''

``In summary, this exploration of the drivers of housing unaffordability suggests the problem may be less with the total supply of housing units and more with their distribution across the population and `overconsumption' by wealthier groups, enabled by rising incomes and easy credit conditions. Policy reforms that could dampen the demand for housing beyond a basic level of need could theoretically enable the UK housing system to satisfy greater housing need without relying on rapid housing expansion. This is welcome, as a solely supply-side explanation would imply that the only way to satisfy more housing need is through housing expansion, despite the inherent environmental impacts.''},

* Ensure fiscal sustainability. Implement the consolidation plan. Raise the retirement age to improve fiscal
sustainability. Ensure full independence for the recently created Office for Budget Responsibility.
* Reform the regulatory framework for the financial sector. Ensure appropriate regulation and supervision
of the financial system, both through national measures and constructive engagement at the international
and European level. Create a “firewall” between high risk investment banking and commercial banking.
* Improve educational outcomes. Increase participation in quality early-childhood education. Improve
educational outcomes and skill formation, especially among disadvantaged children. Discourage early
leaving from the education system. Increase the quality of vocational training and the availability of
high-quality apprenticeship positions to ensure that relevant skills are provided.
* Increase efforts to make work pay and to help workers to fi nd and retain work. Ensure adequate staffing
of Public Employment Services and target existing activation efforts on the most disadvantaged and
hardest-to-place youth.
* Tackle high levels of disability benefit claimants. Ensure that all claimants are covered by the announced
Work Program scheme. Monitor health status earlier and more frequently in the workforce.
* Pursue public sector reforms to improve productivity. Improve productivity and control costs in health care
by containing capitation fees and wages. Reinforce competition among health care providers to mitigate
price pressures. Raise consistency in the allocation of health care responsibility across government
bodies. Improve productivity in education (e.g. through further decentralisation of decision making).
* Promote green growth. Further enhance integration of environmental concerns into national and sectoral
policies in order to move towards green growth and create incentives for the private sector to invest in
green technologies and undertake climate adaptation actions. Turn the Climate Change Levy into a fullfl edged carbon tax. Abolish the reduced VAT rate for domestic energy use and reassess the economic and
environmental effi ciency of other green taxes.
* Increase the effi ciency of the tax system. Address the economic and environmental ineffi ciencies in the
VAT system created by exemptions and reduced rates.
* Prioritise investment in innovation, infrastructure and R\&D. While fiscal consolidation makes severe
budget cuts necessary, growth enhancing activities such as infrastructure, green investment and R\&D
spending should be prioritised. Implement a national road pricing scheme to mitigate road congestion.
* Improve the functioning of the housing market. Make the planning system more flexible, more predictable
and provide incentives for local communities to release land for building, while continuing to protect
the environment. Shift property taxation from stamp duties towards recurrent taxes based on market
property values.},

Begins with the example of Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt PTR established in Germany in 1887 for developing physical standards using funding, land and organisational design by Werner Siemens. Aim to build up scientific bureaucracy - blueprint of how to move from agile and start-up phase to more stable delivery-focus. 

Siemens is a `bureaucracy hacker'

Appointed a charismatic leader

Mission Mystique (term coined by Charles Goodsell in 2010) enables the innovation bureaucracy to cope with the risks and uncertainties associated with innovaiton and lead dynamic changes

Such innovation bureaucracies are established to deal with emerging technological or socio-economic challanges. This was predicted by Max Weber who described how charismatic authority becomes bureaucratic authority and then back to charismatic. Particular categories of organisation - charismatic networks and expert organisations - is often an oscillation between these extremes: agile stability

Looks at two present-day examples

Vinnova, Swedish Innovation Agency, working now being reframed from focusing primarily on technological issues to tackling socio-economic challenges such as rethinking food systems to privde healthy sustainable food in schools.

Agencies that have been sources of policy innovation have tended to be peripheral agencies, not central (Weberian) and such agencies experience less political interference. This is possibly the ``Schumpeterian alternative''.

``Kattel, Drechsler and Karo 2019 have shown, first, such `central-decentral' dynamics in state capacity help explain dynamic capabilities on the system level, but not on the organisational level; and second, the dynamics can be explained through Weber's theory of authority, in particular through the interplay between charismatic and legal-rational forms of authority (Kattel, Drechsler and Karo 2019).''

NPM reforms in 1980s opened public sector up to private sector managerial practice - strategeic manager, agile management - as well as focus on short-term efficiencies - based on the measurement of inputs and outputs, benchmarking and governement indicators. Focus was on inefficiences in big machine-like organisations rather than innovative capacities of public sector.

Pollitt and Bouckeart (2011) posit that Neo-Weberian state (NWS, see Bouckeart2022) is emerging - public organisations provide ``public services, and at the same time recognises the need for more citizen engagement in the design and delivery of public services''. Also identify new public governance theories - ``emphasise the importance of the co-creation and co-production of public services''.

Find that this is little work analysing the capacities and capabilities of public sector organisations. Suggest that these can be understood around organisational routines. Hypothesise the there are 3 main types of routine:
* sense-making (e.g. information gathering and processing)
* connecting (e.g. new networks and coalitions)
* shaping (e.g. new directionality for organisation)

Tests the hypothesis against three case studies: UK's Government Digital Service (GDS), the city of Barcelona and Swedish innovation agency Vinnova.

``In all three cases, we can argue that existing sense-making routines limited organisational learning and autonomy at the same time. New leadership and new organisational structures were critical to instil both new epistemological perspectives and to make sure there were rapid learning feedback loops.''

New connecting routines were created in all three cases, such as through `democratising' of innovation.

``In terms of shaping — executing or implementing — new activities, both GDS and Barcelona offer more mature cases as Vinnova's implementation processes are at earlier stages.''

Sources of dynamic capabilities:
1. political leadership
2. managerial leadership (new managers)
3. new organisation

``Such organisations aim to be both dynamic and resilient by design. We can call these Neo-Weberian agencies.''},

I would need to look more widely to understand better. (from Kattel2022: ``Introduced by Pollitt and Bouckaert in 2011, the Neo-Weberian state posits that a new paradigm of the state is emerging in the era of post-New Public Management reforms.'')

Reference earlier work that identifies 4 ideal types: maintain, modernise, marketise and minimise. Find that in realit, states can be hybrids or blends of these. Maintain and modernise combine in NWS. A combination of marketise and minimised is a fit with New Public Management (NPM).

OECD promosed NPM and New Zealand showcased this. However, reform is more than simply "more or less" NPM, there are other types of modernisation such as NWS.

Weber considered the difference between  `community'(Gemeinschaft) to `society' (Gesellschaft). He considered rational spirit of bureaucracy as efficient and powerful. This paper describes the Weberian state model as holding space between bureaucracy, society and business.

Develops the `driver'-space which is defined by different mechanisms: hierachy (H), markets (M) and networks (N). NWS is more about H and some N, and less M. I find Table 1 which describes the Weberian and Neo components of NWS. One of the Neo elements is ``Shift from an internal orientation towards bureaucratic rulefollowing towards an external orientation towards meeting citizens' needs and wishes. The primary route to achieving this is not the employment of market mechanisms (although they may occasionally come in handy), but the creation of a professional culture of quality and service. ''

There's lots of discussion of the three components H, M and N and transition between them.

NPM is more about M and some N, much less H. New Public Governance (NPG) has the bias towards N, some M and not much H.},

Table 1 gives overview of organisation theories that explain organisational change - useful to return to.

This studies tests possible reasons for creating innovation labs (from classical organizational and evolutionary theories): 
* emulation
* individual learning
* old and new structures (competition and conflict)
* external complexity (environment)
* technology
* expertise / legitimacy

Discusses financing, performance measures

i-labs usually built around a particular user-design-led method (e..g human-centred design, friendly hacker). They tend to employ people from a wide range of backgrounds.

Reasons for formation, mainly from interviews with executives:
* support for the role of external complexity and technology
* conflict between old and new organizational structures was not brought up as a specific reason
* internal learning effects were deemed subservient to external changes
* specific know-how and the autonomy of i-labs were deemed essential for the survival of the organizations
* some emulation and fad of labs can be justified as a causal factor
* ``politicians were able to show credible commitment to innovation through the creation of public-sector i-labs''
* the reasons for formation do not necessarily remain relevant to goals and logics later on
* other main activities include coordination with other government bodies

Autonomy in salary-setting and staff evaluation, goal-setting was present in many organisations. i-labs are ``supposed'' to be disruptive. ``exist in turbulent and conflicting environments''. However, they have no authority over other public-sector structures and have limited ability to catalyse and push through public-sector-wide changes.

Argue that:
1. creation of i-labs can be tied to external complexity and technology propositions - tech plays a central role
2. its a bit of a fad after ealier i-labs
3. its supposed to catalyse change but autonomy alone is not enough to challenge existing structures [my comments below on this]
4. i-labs tend to have somewhat higher `mortality' that other public sector organisations
5. have a reliance on external ICT capabilities

[izzy - our experience of research and innovation is that it is difficult to permeate the existing organisation. p1474 of this paper discusses how ``and the lack of supportive culture and authority to routinize new solutions limit the potential of i-labs to enact the change-agent's role'']},

Suggests that Weber was not original in his observation of modern bureaucracies as German Brockhaus encyclopedia of 1819 complains about the use of pens when word of mouth has previously done the work.

Weber's analysis was distinctive in how he identified that it was necessary to bring together qualified officials with a systematized organisation.

Give nice history of bureaucracy from paper-based systems, including search, to IT.

The Weberian concept with in-house operations seemed an inadequate idea by the 1990s when much IT is done by external agencies.

Mintzberg (e.g. Mintzberg1996) characterised some Weberian bureaucracies as `machine bureaucracies'. Within this model, IT services are not core but part of the support services. They may even be out-sourced.

``Machine bureaucracies tend to be the dominant organizational form for the biggest users of civilian government IT at national government level''

``there is unlikely to be a director of IT on the management board''

Shows Hood's categorisation of government roles, each having detector (finding out) and effector (getting done) tools:
* Nodality - government is central to society's information networks
* Authority - make laws and regulation that coerce/enforce
* Treasure - secure the provision of goods and services
* Organisation - delivery of services
* Expertise - accumulation [and application?]  of knowledge

Herbert Simon argued that computers could reshape an organisation in 3 ways:
* creating more accessible organisational `memory'
* more information and more potential to problem-solve in modern societies
* increasing the decision-processing capacity - anticipating web and internet impacts

Nice quote from Rose 1990 about how technology is not just the hardware and software but also ``the inculcation of a form of life, the reshaping of various roles for human practices, the mental techniques required in terms of certain practices of communication, the practices of the self orientated around the mobile telephone, the word processor, the World Wide Web, and so forth.''

`audit explosion' - a growth of internal regulators and the linking of key performance indicators (KPIs) to NPM reorganizations (Power 1994).

IT systems effect on policy:
1. can limit  policy-makers' discretionary action whereas that other constaints can be overcome
2. Work-arounds with IT systems can be time/money/capacity prohibative
3. The costs, complexity, and difficulty of IT investments and renewals tend to grow over time
4. The above have feedback implications for administrators' behaviour
5. This can lead to contracting out IT which means specifying what the service and capability should be, which can be less flexible, as can simply working with contractor rather than in-house

Contractors generally reckoned that by winning a contract they would be able to earn much more by requests for new capacity or specification changes.

The Weberian model seemed partial, almost from the start, because it could not explain many real-world examples (including Britain). 

In many systems, those who enter the civil service are trained (to an elite level) in a range of (often general) skills but not IT - and so machine bureaucracies (unlike welfare state agencies - Mintzberg's Professional bureaucracies) tended to be led by IT illiterate managers.  [Does this reflect Mintzberg1996 - if they've managed something, they can manage anything?]. In US, in contrast, departments were run by relevant specialists - although this also seems to be the case.},

Discusses the relationship between different organisations and people

private v public debate:
* capitalism versus communism
* privatization versus nationalization
* the markets of business versus the controls of government
is limited dichotomy

There are 4 types of organisation:
* privately owned
* publicly owned - should really be called state owned
* cooperatively owned - absence of stock market pressures is important for their ability to take a long-term perspective
* non-owned (aka NGOs but also non-business owned and non-cooperatively owned, NBO and NCO)

Private- and state-owned are similar in that they are controlled by hierachies and can be transformed into each other

Despite discourse of people as `customers' of government, looking at the functions that state performs, people can be 
* customer - fits only a few roles of government (lottery tickets!)
* citizen - use of public, government and state infrastructure
* client - one-sided professional service, what the state provides us
* subject - one-sided, respecting state controls

``Couldn't the current malaise about government really stem from its being too much like business rather than not enough?''

Discusses management - or rather Management

Three assumptions underlie the Management view of management, which collapse when considering what government agencies have to do:
* activities can be isolated and autonomous - Many government activities are interconnected and cannot be isolated
* performance can be evaluated by objective measures - Many activities are in the public sector precisely because of measurement problems / requires soft judgment
* activities can be managed by professional managers - managers are too often ignorant of the subject of their management.

``management. Such a situation just breeds cynicism. In mortal fear of not meeting the holy numbers, managers run around reorganizing constantly, engendering more confusion than clarification.''

Discusses model of managing government
1. Government-as-Machine - countervailing force to corruption, lacks flexibility, still dominant
2. Government-as-Network - interactive and free-flowing, organised around projects
3. Performance-Control - make government more like business, the ideal is the divisional structure that conglomerates in particular have popularized
4. Virtual-Government - best government is no government, superstructure exists to arrange for private organizations to provide public services
5. Normative-Control - Control is rooted in values and beliefs, has been essential but not recognised: service and dedication muted the negative effects of bureaucracy.

Normative model has 5 elements:
* Selection
* Socialisation
* Guidance
* Responsibility
* Judgement

Discuss governing managment

``If people believe that government is bumbling and bureaucratic, then that is what it will be''

Businesses can learn from governments, not just vice versa

``the mistaken belief that those who have managed something can manage anything''

``Private sector values are now pervading all of society''

The institution shapes individuals' preferences - New Instituitionalism

Identifies the elements of administrative traditions:
1. state and society
   * organic - state linked and not particularly distinct from society, reform would alter fundamental nature of state
   * contractarian - state arises from conscious social and political contract, constitution, reformable, e.g anglo-american
2. law versus management
   * legalistic: public administration is for administering public law, virtually Weberian, administrators trained as lawyers  e.g. German and French systems (althought NPM has overlayed managerialist ideas)
   * managerialist: public administration is to get things done, law is the beginning (not the end) for PA, e.g. NPM, UK, NZ
   * senior public servant as policy advisor somewhat cuts across these two conceptions - capacity to draft law but also advise on possible social, economic, political consequences of policy
3. administration and politics
   * some traditions assert that public service should be politically neutral, although it often isn't, government should accept administrators (or quietly move them aside)
   * others see political involvement as acceptible even beneficial, government is expected to appoint its own administrators
   * ``NPM devalues the concept of a career, neutral civil service in favor of a more committed and perhaps temporary service''
4. the career
   * career civil servants, in some cases trained in dedicated educational establishments
   * recruitment into and out of civil service
5. state and society II - the role of social interest in government decision making
   * involvement of societal actors can seen seen as legitimating the state and restraining its autonomy, corporatism is common example
   * societal interests represented by advisory commitees, interest groups, NGOs
   * interest groups undermine the authority of the state
   * government fosters support from interest groups
6. uniformity - in policy and administration
   * create uniformity across the nation e.g. France; French, Belgian, Portungese direct rule over colonies
   * recognise differences across the nation e.g. German federal system; British idirect rule over India
   * equality versus self-determination
   * more co-ordinated federalism may result in greater uniformity
7. accountability
   * controls enforced by political actors and legislature versus accountability is primarily internal action
   * accountability enforced after action, or action requires approval
   * perception of corruption leading to NPM (but some NPM reforms have reduced accountability)

Uses these variable to define 4 traditions in Westerrn administration:
* Anglo-American - (some US divergence)
* Germanic
* Napoleonic
* Scandinavian

- Variation within traditions
- Dilution in former colonies
- Netherlands, and to some extent Belgium, combine Germanic with Napoleonic
- Finland is Scandinavian but with some elements remaining from Russian, whilst this was overlaid on Swedish
- Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary recent Russian and earlier Germanic from Austro-Hungarian Empire

Code for America formed by Pahlka in 2009, which placed small teams in public sector to use technology to quickly and creatively solve problems

US food stamp service, SNAP, and particularly California's version, CalFresh

CalFresh had a high churn rate - people dropping off and having to reapply, or who did not come back despite not being food secure. Reapplication also wasteful of resources. Churn due to bad experiences, difficult forms, forms not being received, or in wrong language, confusing notices about changes to benefits and action required, etc. 

Set up an account to experience what CalFresh applicants / recipients experience. Also experience of one member of team who gained real experience of process through drop in salary.

As a result, set up their own website with user-friendly interface that sent data to CalFresh system and discovered that this worked [luckily - ethical red flags here!]. This was later scaled.

Some conflict between serving needs of funders (government or business) and needs of users - maintained user-centred design.},

Core Values of Agile
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

12 Principles of Agile
1. Seek to fulfill the customer's needs. Do so through the early delivery of software. Continuously improve that software.
2. Respond to the demand for changes to that software because doing so better positions the customer for success.
3. Shorten the timescale for the delivery of working software. Deliver changes frequently.
4. Developers should work hand in hand with business users.
5. Center fabrication around individuals motivated to succeed.
6. Emphasize face-to-face conversation within the team and between the development team and the broader organization.
7. The most important benchmarks are working software.
8. Sustainable development is the goal. All involved parties should be able to maintain a constant pace of engagement.
9. Continuously focus on technical quality and good design.
10. Emphasize simplicity.
11. Self-organization in teams improves design and production.
12. Regularly reflect on how to improve this process.

4 values and 12 principles establish a feedback loop

``Agile projects have four times more successes and one-third fewer failures than waterfall projects (SerradorP2015; Standish Group 2015)''

``agile emphasizes bottom-up change over top-down direction (or even
outside-in from vendors or consultants)''

``Agile Is Antithetical to Many Typical Bureaucratic Line Organizations...managers who need to take responsibility for actions may not be willing to do so given how cross-functional agile teams work ... If experimentation is not part of the toolbox, and if bureaus value organizational reputation and avoid public failures, agile never gains traction ... in organizations largely characterized by “we have seen this before, let's wait until the next wave comes in,” traditionalists could see agile as another fad that will be replaced''},

  comment          = {Loads of examples of how administrative burden can be used to enact policies, sometimes in a covert manner, for public good or sometimes bad.

Identify three types of cost that citizens incur when encountering the state: 
- learning costs (in having to develop knowledge and skills to understand what entitlements they can access)
- compliance costs (in having to fill out forms, submit to checks, and so on in gaining entitlements and avoiding sanctions)
- psychological costs (in having to endure stigmatizing experiences)

Examples include voter registration, polling stations, food stamps, health insurance, abortion, tax credits, old age benefits, social security,

``focus on the costs that people encounter when they search for information about public services (learning costs), comply with rules and requirements (compliance costs), and experience the stresses, loss of autonomy, or stigma that come from such encounters (psychological costs)''

``Individuals care as much or more about the process of their interactions with the state as they do about the outcome''

Burdens can be a policy instrument which thwart people's access - could be easier for gov to do than legislature required for more visible policymaking.

``Higher voter participation tends to increase the share of low-income voters, resulting in more generous welfare services, greater equality, more progressive taxation, and less restrictive welfare participation rules. If policymakers and administrators use their authority to influence who votes in elections, they are also influencing the policies that will be adopted after the election, and the burdens that accompany those policies''

Some policies create their own industries which can then lobby for the extention of the policy - e.g. tax credits in US, the tax preparation service lobbied not only for the expansion of the policy but also to maintain enough documentation requirements to ensure tax credit remains
burdensome enough that low-income workers seek professional tax preparation help

``Shifting burdens away from citizens requires a well-functioning administrative state''

``Republicans figured out how to build a politics of burdens that Democrats have been unable or unwilling to develop. Republicans have done so despite the fact that in other areas—such as the regulation of businesses, campaign donations, or firearms—they have also been successful in opposing governmentally imposed burdens in the name of liberty''

Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an IT phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.},

*  the representation of culture as a mathematized, mappable space
* `data is always a temporal formation' - it isdated, sampled from a particular moment in time. But anthropologists can do morethan relocate data in its proper temporal context: we can examine how data is enlistedin efforts to produce new temporalities
* taxonomies, DNA of biological species, finding the temporalitiesof both data collection and storage entangled with the history of colonialism
* the creation of bunkers for data conceptualised as a vulnerable collection of networked traces,always at risk of being wiped out of existence by catastrophic events

* Organisational structure, capturing the way the organisation is set-up and individuals and teams interact within it.

Overarching conclusions:
1. The Net Zero Target Operating Model attributes are likely to be relevant across all public sector organisations.
2. Whilst the attributes are relevant to all organisations, they will look different for different organisations.
3. Typically, stronger leadership at a more senior level promotes greater commitment across the organisation to support decarbonisation delivery.
4. Developing a high-level strategy which can be communicated across the organisation sets a clear statement of intent, however, a strategy should be backed up with detailed scaled delivery plans.
5. Linking decarbonisation to organisational values makes explicit its importance to departmental operations.
6. Incorporating carbon evaluation metrics into operational process, including business case development and approval, and other decision-making, will unlock and support scaled delivery of decarbonisation.
7. Enhancing existing information reporting systems with energy, cost and carbon related data will empower stakeholders through better and more timely knowledge.
8. Capacity needs to be built for scale and in the right places in the organisation, through mapping of the needs and requirements in each area of the organisation. Skills needs will vary dependent on the type of activity that each actor is going to fulfil.
9. If capacity is not available within the organisation then it should be sought from the supply chain, though care should be taken to ensure that consistent and high-quality support is obtained. Capacity will be needed to support delivery, from installation to onsite security escorting contractors.
10. Improving general carbon literacy throughout the public sector will support better buy-in, wider adoption, and scaled decarbonisation. 
11. Having a clearly defined Net Zero organisational structure, that complements the overall organisational structure, will provide clarity to those across the organisation on roles and responsibilities. Attributing clear targets and goals to each group will support delivery.
12. A high-level Net Zero strategy and its underlying delivery plans must consider how all the Net Zero Target Operating Model attributes will be fulfilled, to support decarbonisation at scale in line with relevant targets. This may mean a step change in current deployment plans.
13. Trials and tests of technologies, process and decision-making, and different commercial routes must continue, but be more joined up. Knowledge from trials should be captured and shared more widely to help demonstrate scaled delivery models. 
14. Recording standard information for sharing amongst a community either within a sector or more widely would help others understand how they can deploy at scale.
Departments and other public sector organisations need a committed multi-year budget to be able to start to deliver at scale.
15. Clear direction on expectations for departments and other public sector organisations would support the development of scaled decarbonisation plans.
16. More guidance and collaboration across Government, to support shared learning and speed of uptake efficiently.},

Book is about reconceiving the role of the CIO.

Brilliant, easy to follow, book attempting to identify the role of the CIO in an Agile organisation. CIOs cannot get a 'seat at the table' (in the c-suite) without proving that IT is of strategic value. Books on Agile do not acknowledge the CIO and books on being a CIO do not acknowledge Agile. Currently, IT is considered something that costs and needs control, a plan, etc which works against Agile practise.

Notes that immediate cultural change is ``strangely non-Agile'' p13

There's always conflict: pleasing the customer does not always mean strategic goals are being met or it could mean that the senior management cannot understand what is happening. Sometimes its just that the CIO feels excluded. p14

Scope creep: changes that the business stakeholders request when they realize that a system won't actually meet their needs as specified ... but which might make it difficult for IT to show that it is delivering on schedule p30 this incentivises getting the requirements perfect from the outset and feature bloat p52 ``a requirement is a constraint masquerading as a decision'' p105 ``Scope doesn't creep, understanding grows'' (Patton) p108

Governance process is passive, saying no, judgemental process, its like a reality TV show. p175-6

Some kind of oversight is always desired so they came up with an Agile governence and oversight model help interface with expectations of waterfall style organisation, including:
- investment decision and oversight process form a seamless continuum - initiative informs governance decision
- progress gauged by operational results
- boundaries set for planning, don't waste time on too much planning
- decisions made on high-level objectives, not detailed requirements
- transparent, trusted processes for turning business objectives into product parameters
- optimise the whole - EA, people and data

  comment          = {Looks at organisations (with focus on private sector) and considers the development of a change-oriented organisational structure

Starts with idea of evolutionary economics but identifies that dynamic capabilities cannot sit within this theory -  this is more Schumpeterian and also has roots in behaviour theory of the firm

About dynamic capabilities - something that entrepreneurs have - that embraces discontinuous change

Largely about manangers, assumes they are source of culture and change in organisation. Sense is of hierachical organisations [IMO even the entrepreneurial ones]

Managers and entrepreneurs are different

``I believe the dynamic capabilities framework can serve as a vehicle for clarifying the relationship between routines and innovation''

``Organisations need routines to get the day-to-day work done. They economise on bounded rationality. The dynamic capabilities framework recognises routines as the very essence of operational (ordinary) capabilities''

(Irritatingly) talks about the `exceptional talents' of `great innovators and integrators such as Henry Ford ... Elon Musk' which seems to assume a predisposition rather than fortune of these people

However, discussion of an ``entrepreneurial state of mind'' and ``entrepreneurial decision-making'' and how these lead to dynamic capabilities

`ordinary capabilities' == `first-order capabilities' (Winter) == `metaroutines' - include industry best practice and incremental changes
These are bought or imitated by rival and so are unlikely to give rise to competitive advantage

Instead, `Teecian dynamic capabilities' which are characteristics that reside on the top management, organisational culture and structure and drive strategic activities. Winter may have described this as ad hoc problem solving and improviation but Teece notes that it may suggest a `quasi-routine for how an entrepreneurially-led organisation solves problems'. Entrepreneurial decision-making is a hybrid of routine and ad hoc approaches.

Schumpeter's entrepreneur: leader  ... new techniques ... new comminations. Everyone has the skills to some degree.

Urban sees Musk as innovator using first principles as building blocks combined with experience and instinct

Winter sees innovation as requiring ``talented cooks'' who first imagine the dish, based on understanding of the ingredients/conditions and then iterate over attempted solutions: ``there is no simple answer to the question of where knowledge comes from''

``there are creative and insight-dependent components that cannot be routinised''

Contrasts 3 roles of managers: operational, entrepreneurial and leadership and tables the responsibilities, activities, levers and goals of each.

Entrepreneurship is not adaptation but making of ``new combinations''

``Tenacity, unwavering self-confidence, optimism and a tolerance for stress [iz: and privilege] are traits of successful entrepreneurs

The entrepreneurial state of mind, scanning/sensing and open communication channels should be encouraged through the organisation
Entrepreneurial managers sense, seize, orchestrate, invest in R\&D, develop new business models and seek competitive advantage

``Evolutionary innovations are generally modelled along a single dimension (usually technology) in which change occurs, when in fact there are many ways in which organisations can change, including their internal structure, organisational boundaries, business models, market positioning''. Also time

Organisation change in anticipation of environmental change - but entrepreneurs also shape the environment

``wild orchestration''

``Dynamic capabilities of the public sector are higher-order bundles of political, policy and organizational routines and managerial decisions that drive the strategic activities of public organisations in regimes of deep uncertainty and wicked challenges''},

  comment          = {Short easy read about using Agile approaches to digitally transform an organisation, such as the Government Digital Service (GDS)

4 things are required for a digital transformation: a crisis, a political leader,  a team and a mission.

``... a crisis is almost always an essential condition for digitally transforming a government and there's no shortage of them the challenge is choosing the right crisis''

``Megaprojects and the eye-popping budget overruns are often a good source of crisis material 9 out of 10 government projects with an initial budget of at least £1 billion end up spending more than originally planned''

``Before a country can really begin its journey of digital transformation it needs to find ... groups of engaged people''

``your first digital team will define the working culture and how things are done''

Also covers:
* Design principles
* Starting small
* Release fast, iteratively
* Roles with the team
* Clean structure and working patterns
* Culture
* Performance metrics
* Platforms

``Agile is a rejection of applying for certainty to delivering policy with technology''

``many innovation teams find themselves trapped in the purgatory of being an add on to the day to day rather than a force charged with fundamentally reshaping the organisation''

``innovation teams are destined to always run one step ahead of the rest of the organisation and incentivised to help everyone catch up with them how can you be innovative if everyone is doing the same as you?''

``arguably by having shown that things could be done differently they have done their job whether or not the business brothers to put the theory into practice''

``to have a chance of success a digital mandate must make it possible to stop poorly conceived usually expensive and long IT contracts from being let''

Gather evidence

``there is a real advantage to keeping your strategic ambitions ambiguous as long as possible''

``the digital strategy must act as a signal towards the operating model you want your whole organisation to adopt and the culture that will allow that to happen successfully''

Set the right expectation if you don't know what to under promise and over deliver
However
Making your first draught strategy ambitious gives you more chips to bargain with later

In government there's a paternalistic view that the user doesn't know what they need it's a bit of an excuse they need a public service that is simple and clear enough for them to complete it accurately and quickly so they can get on with their day. Intuitively know they need to have certain qualities.

Creating new rules and standards allows you to scale practise across an organisation quickly

``Change is physically and mentally draining the conflict it brings especially so. Digital transformation of any large organisation is tiring partly because it is about loss''

``we're unconvinced that organisations are unable to provide their employees with a reliable system for filing their travel expenses should be better in the house on nailing the implications of artificial intelligence''

``direction a government chooses to take with AI is as much a political choice that as it is a technological one that is so far removed from the old paperwork as to feel like an entirely separate conversation''},

Construct a model to demonstrate where good PA falls. This there are three possible forms of good PA. Small nucleus the almost always works anywhere. A larger core that is generally valid. A third level where solutions work well well within a given paradigm but not necessarily outside of this and us these solutions are not easily transferred.

* Imperial civil service exam
* Perpetually reforming and adapting PA
* Concept of Mandate of Heaven (by which failure would indicate the mandate has been lost and the public servants would tose their job) which incentivises strong performance as well as as a desire to innovate

``Ethics policies have been largely scandal- not value-driven''

Accountability - system of external control - compliance approach
Ethics - system is internal control - integrity approach

Ethically good also defined in terms of law obedience, impartiality and standardisation

Weberian approach has an ethic of neutrality but this is unrealistic and too narrow in today's multilevel governance

There are codes of rules and regulations which set clear expectations

There are codes of ethics, such as UK Committee on Standards in Public Life 7 principles: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. They are not statutory, there are few guidelines and they cannot be enforced.

There are codes of conduct - aspirational and expectation values. May be seen as transforming princioles of ethics into practice.

Increased public and media scrutiny leads to more scandals and failure often attributed to not enough law. There is a trend towards more rules and monitoring.

Could these ethics policies impact administrative procedures? There is also little understanding of the nature of growing number of specialised ethics bodies.  

The trends in ethics literature:
Focus on scandals and failures of public officials and resulting decreased levels of trust
Consideration of whether there is now too much it too little ethics rules
Broadening and diversification if the whole discussion

Yet still not much clarity on what works to support ethical practise.  Also focus on rules etc. and less on the impact (or costs and benefits) of policies on behaviours etc.

Higher prestige positions attract offers of board memberships in companies and organisations - rules and standards may be appropriate in this case

Strict transparency requirements do not automatically improve public trust. More ethical rules may cause even more cynicism and have not resulted to a rise in public confidence in government.

Argues that approach to integrity in government must advance beyond the "bad person" model and look at social psychology of organisational life and the capacity of individuals and leaders understand be critical of their own behaviour.

There is conflicting evidence and explanations of how NPM has contributed to increased or decreased integrity. 

Ethically behaviour in the workplace is influenced by:
Individual characteristics
Moral issue characteristics
Organisational characteristics

Discusses the possible impact of the financial crisis on ethical motivations and behaviour in the workplace assumption that result would be negative but there are are also some reasons for positive behavioural outcomes.

The reasons for these reforms revered to blame civil service and assume that all organisations, private or public and with public sector, are the same

Herbert Simon noted that adminstrative life often has paired features such that maximizing one week minimise the other

Reasons to blame civil service. It's:
 a monopoly - no competition, can extract higher than needed funds
 our of touch - both with political masters (and rather like the status quo) and with what clients world want
 out of control- pursues it's own goals. Notes that if it doesn't, it's uninnovative so can't win.
It's badly managed - wrong rewards and incentives, assumption that private sector motivational devices would be better
 financially mismanaged

Highly penetrating scrutiny (highlighting crises in finance, environment etc) from increasing range of media subjects government officials to irony that, with so many more means to deliver public goods, it is more difficult to satisfy demands for accountability

Discusses impact of NPM - it removed rules so as to give freedom to act but resulted in at least equivalent transaction costs in performance review, legalistic procedures

The argument that someone cannot be held responsible for consequences of following one's orders was rejected by the Nuremberg Trials.

With so many scrutiny instruments such as legislative processes and committees, constitutional / statutory requirements, official information and privacy enactments, ombudsman, auditing and media watch dogs, politicians maybe more likely to be sanctioned less for failing to achieve than for failing to do so correctly

  comment          = {About Wardley mapping

A business, like all organisms, needs to continuously adapt to changes in order to survive and if we could somehow describe this then maybe that would give us a map?

Throughout our history, it has always been standardisation of components that has enabled creations of greater complexity

The desire to differentiate creates the novel, the desire to keep up with others makes it commonplace

The map has an anchor which is the user

Each component needs the component below it, however the higher up the map a component is then the more visible it becomes to the user. The lower it is then the less visible it becomes.

There is a flow of risk, information and money between components

Stages of evolution:
- genesis
- custom built
- product (including rental)
- commodity (including utility)

the x-axis of evolution shows the terms for activities alone

A single node on one map can be an entire map from another person's perspective. Equally, the entire map of your business might be a single component for someone else.},

  comment          = {Tim O'Reilly spoke about GaaP has two aspects - a platform that others e.g. private sector can build upon and a way that citizens can participate in government. I find this second idea very interesting but I can only find evidence that GaaP is just at the level of services at the moment.

He proposed seven principles of GaaP: openness, simplicity, participation, `learning from hackers', data mining, experimentation and `leading by example'. This paper looks at Estonia and identifies that it meets the first (except it learns `by example') and does less well on the final three. It's argue that they have focused on the service now and less in the future service. UK seems to be a bit the opposite by embracing experimentation, days mining and a `hacking' culture but struggles with openness, simplicity and participation.

Lots of detail in the Estonian case and quite a bit on UK.

Quotes a study that find the costs are in organisation and processes, not technology and important elements are political will, organisational reforms, adaptation of legal frameworks and redesign of work processes.

I also like that Estonia's CIO is the `Central' Information Officer},

These systems are being increasingly used in many domains, including in humanitarian response, but their behaviours are often not understood in their entirety''.

``risks and harms include: 
- questions of biases and fairness which can oppress minority voices
- accountability of systems and the lack of legal frameworks
- challenges surrounding transparency and human oversight
- a lack of expertise in the proper and appropriate deployment and use of AI
- data privacy and protection concerns; and the meaningful participation of affected communities in every stage of the AI lifecycle, as well as their ownership over such systems''

``drive to draft AI ethical guidelines, frameworks, and training materials at the international, national, and sector specific levels''

Their proposal for future research / activities are more widely relavant than simply humanitarian applications, imo:
1. ``development of frameworks for building and testing multi-AI systems, as well as for understanding emergent behaviours of such systems is essential''
  - mapping the network of information flows
  - stresss tests for systems
2. ``cross-pollination of these technical communities with legal, ethics, and humanitarian response experts''
  - systematic mapping exercise to understand the potential gaps in existing ethical principles and guidelines
  - adapt current risk and harms assessments
3. communicate these concepts to project managers and decision-makers
  - operational guidelines
  - capacity building exercises
  - communities of practice
4. greater collaboration including: complex systems, multi-agent modelling, systems engineering, and reinforcement learning},

Governments must:
- embrace technology-enabled experimentation and decentralisation - iteration, empowered teams
- set agenda - be purposeful, national missions
- provide software and data infrastructure
- reset structures, break through silos, more pathways for promotion, diverse training schemes, cross-functional teams, technology to enable interoperability between teams ...

``Francis Maude advocated a “tight-loose” model for government in the United Kingdom (UK): tight central control over key areas of public spending to drive down costs, combined with devolution of power and the opening up of partnerships to promote innovation''

Princples:
1. purposeful government and policy, national missions for grand challenges (Mazzucato gets lots of mentions)
2. provide public services and infrastructure that allow individuals, communities, businesses and the public sector to achieve their potential
3. be able to respond quickly

``embed a culture of continuous improvement both within and outside the public sector''

``anticipatory frameworks for regulation would cohere with a government strategy intent on iterating, experimenting and harnessing the opportunities of technological change''

Discussion of metrics of public value, GDP, CBA, social value and ``doughnut dashboads''

Gaap, mostly tier 1 and 2 - but should move on tier 3 as well - society wide platform (banks, charities and other external organsations)

``governments should establish a new presumption in favour of all new services having to publish and document an API''

``governments must create an electronic-identity system for all citizens'' 

``Buying Into The Future report suggest[s] creating spend controls for in-house expenditure, to incentivise governments not to reject ready-made solutions in the private sector''

``Restructuring can also be extremely costly, according to the Institute for Government, a UK think tank, with new departments costing up to £15 million (\$19 million) to establish.112 This cost can rise even higher when one takes into account productivity losses—mainly, but not only, if these changes are rushed—and settlements due to levelling up the salaries of staff from merging departments'' but there is some transformation needed - be strategic

Key concepts:
1. Cultural capacities as adaptations: Culture, cultural transmission, and cultural evolution arise from genetically evolved psychological adaptations for acquiring ideas, beliefs, values, practices, mental models, and strategies
2. Cultural evolution: These cognitive adaptations give rise to a robust second system of inheritance that operates by different transmission rules than genetic inheritance, and can thus produce phenomena not observed in other less cultural species
3. Culture-gene coevolution: The second system of inheritance created by cultural evolution can alter both the social and physical environments faced by evolving genes

Find:
1. disruptive innovations exhibit distinctive spatial clustering in phases understood to be those in which industrial revolutions reshape the economy; they are increasingly dispersed in other periods
2. that the ranks of locations that capture the most disruptive innovation are relatively unstable across industrial revolutions
3. regression estimates suggest a role for disruptive innovation in regulating overall patterns of spatial output and income inequality},

This is a huge transformation

China's state institutions were not market players. Prices were consciously set not to reflect costs.

Options were to 
- implement current (1980s) approach, now called ``shock therapy'' - overnight liberalisation of prices, or 
- dual track reform - planned and market track - produce to meet the plan and then have the option to produce for the market

George Soros identified in Hungary and Yugoslavia that rapid price liberalisation would be dangerous

Friedman pushed for price liberalisation because this had worked in postwar Germany (Erhart Miracle). But in Germany, there were market institutions.

Argues:
-  `Schumpeterian development agencies' (SDAs), public organizations with a mandate to facilitate innovation in new industries, played a critical role in precipitating industrial adjustment
- these agencies occupied a peripheral position in the public sector where limited access to resources exposed these agencies to new ideas and limited political interference

1. concept of the Schumpeterian development agency
2. policy-makers in small states introduced STI programmes and faced scling and monitoring of policies with exposure to domestic networks and international competition
3. policy-makers relied on agencies and instruments, and these relied on inter-personal networks and international competition to scale and monitor developmental projects

Washington concensus seeked to identify a best practice that in reality either cannot be applied without translation or does not work in the same way in the unique circumstances of each application

In small states, inter-elite networks mean that policy-makers, industry representatives and other key decision-makers are more likely to know and trust one another. This means projects can be scaled. But its also harder to kill projects. SDAs can find it harder to penetrate these networks. 

Small states tend to be more internationally open which, for several reasons, facilitates monitoring and enables easier adaptation or abandonment of programmes. However, agencies that had STI policies that comply with interestnational regulations are monitored less and find it more difficult to adapt policies particularly during good times.

Finland - Sitra - independant think-tank and SDA. Demand-side innovation policy and investment in easly stage risk. Science (and Technology) Policy Council linked ministers and prime minister and also ran courses on economic policy and the importance of innovation for policy-makers, corp execs, trade union leaders and journalists. Adaptations happened during downturns.

Israel - Office of the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Trade and Industry (OCS) -  conditionally repayable loans, intensive and repeated meeting with decision makers in private industry, educating them about the value of R\&D and infusing them with enthusiasm toward technological innovation

``In successfully scaling new initiatives, Finnish and Israeli SDAs dramatically raised their profile within the public sector and the economy as a whole, increasing political interference and inhibiting policy experimentation.''},

the debate on STI and DUI modes originates in the so-called “innovation paradox” in which the inputs (e.g. R\&D expenditure) are not reflected in the level of innovation and economic output

STI innovation mode supports interactions with centres producing new knowledge - mainly research centres and universities, scientific brokers and foundations for the diffusion of scientific research - which generate the codified and explicit knowledge that can be used by the firm to produce innovations

DUI innovation - in the form generated by the capacity of the firm to develop informal and formal exchanges internal to the firm, but also interactions with suppliers, customers and competitors

these modes might complement each other in the production of higher outcomes in terms of both innovation and economic performance

This paper studies the Basque Autonomous Community in Spain

``From a policy-making and a business practice perspective, some critical implications may be drawn. In particular, the fact that most businesses adopt a DUI type of interaction does not imply that it is an effective interaction mode. It delivers lower impact (than STI factors) in technological and radical innovation, whereas it matters more for non-technological innovation. And it is inadequate when it is bounded to the regional environment (DUI-regional)''.},

  abstract         = {STI (Science, Technology, and Innovation) and DUI (Doing, Using, and Interacting) are two different types of innovation policies, each with its own focus and objectives.

STI innovation policy emphasizes the importance of scientific research and development, technology advancement, and innovation in driving economic growth and societal progress. STI policies are often associated with funding for research and development, tax incentives for innovation, and the creation of science parks and innovation hubs. The objective of STI policies is to create new technologies, products, and services that can drive economic growth and improve the quality of life for citizens.

Examples of STI innovation policy include the funding of scientific research and development by the National Science Foundation in the United States, the creation of science parks such as the Cambridge Science Park in the UK, and tax incentives for innovation offered by many countries to encourage private sector investment in research and development.

DUI innovation policy, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of innovation in everyday practices, including doing, using, and interacting. DUI policies focus on the adoption of existing technologies and the development of new practices that can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance competitiveness. The objective of DUI policies is to promote innovation at the grassroots level and to encourage the adoption of new practices by firms, organizations, and individuals.

Examples of DUI innovation policy include the provision of training and education to workers to help them adopt new technologies and practices, the promotion of collaborative practices and partnerships between firms, and the development of user-centered design methodologies that involve users in the design of new products and services.

In summary, STI policies focus on the creation of new technologies and innovations through scientific research and development, while DUI policies focus on the adoption of existing technologies and the development of new practices through everyday doing, using, and interacting.},

US society has solved many fundamental but relatively easy problems (clean water, transport, waste disposal, ...). People continue to demand change to the system. The planning system needs to turn to other issues. It needs to define its goals and problems whilst addressing issues of equity.

PPBS - Planning, Programming and Budgeting System - requires statement of desired outcomes (introduced as a response to recognition that incrementalism - tweaking policy rather than determining if it is the correct policy - was not working)

``one of the most intractable problems is that of defining problems (of knowing what distinguishes an observed condition from a desired condition)'' as well as working out what actions would solve the problem.

Talks about the problem of the idealised planning system and how it actually works - which is constant adjustment and evaluation (Iz - it needs to be agile?). The application of science and engineering approaches to society has not worked.

``Planning problems are inherently wicked'' (not tame or benign) and have at least 10 distinguishing characteristics:
1. There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem - all the possible solutions are part of the definition of the problem
2. Wicked problems have no stopping rule - solving and understanding are part of the same process which ends when some external criterion is met
3. Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad - there are many parties whom are equipped, interested and/or entitled to judge
4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem - any solution will generate waves of consequences
5. Every solution to a wicked problem is a `one-shot operation'; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly 
6. Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan
7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique 
8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem
9. The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution
10. The planner has no right to be wrong - a problem statement is not a hypothesis to be refuted and thus planners are liable for the consequences of actions they generate

Small minorities can comprise large numbers of people, the concept of the social product is not very meaningful; possibly there is no aggregate measure for the welfare of a highly diversified society

Whilst the political and governance challenges of climate change have been discussed at length, there is little understanding of how politicians, as influential individuals within the political system, understand or respond to climate change. This article presents findings from 14 qualitative interviews with Members of the UK Parliament, to discuss how politicians conceptualise climate change, and their deliberations on whether or how to act on the issue. First, it reviews an interdisciplinary literature from sociology, political theory and science and technology studies, to investigate how politicians navigate their work and life. Second, it presents `composite narratives' to provide four different MPs' stories. Last, it draws conclusions and implications for practice. It highlights three crucial factors: identity, or how politicians consider the climate issue in the context of their professional identity and the cultural norms of their workplace; representation, how politicians assess their role as a representative, and whether proposed political action on climate is seen as compatible with this representative function; and working practices, how day-to-day work rituals and pressures influence the aims, ambitions and engagement of politicians with climate change.},
  comment          = {See also \url{https://green-alliance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Building_a_political_mandate_for_climate_action.pdf}

Most politicians do understand the need to act on climate change. MPs have three linked considerations:
1. How does climate action fit within their role?
2. What mandate do they have?
3. How to address climate change in day to day realities of political life?

Politicians see climate change as an ``outsider issue'' and tends to mainly be considered in economic terms. Politicians get little push from voters on the issue of climate change and so finding ``representative claims'' for climate action can be difficult. Three representative claims that may be used:
- Cosmopolitan claim - its in the interests of the global community to act
- Local prevention claim - its in the interests of the local community to prevent impacts such as local flooding
- Co-benefits claim - most common includes improving local economies and services by supporting climate action
- Surrogate claim - don't talk about climate but act on it e.g. on sustainable transport

During interviews, interviewees tended to steer the conversation away from climate ``like they don't want to think about [it]''

Created stories for 4 composite polticians:
- The climate champion, willing to speak out even though many constituents do not seem concerned
- The newcomer, cautious and careful to put his constituency first
- The realist, focuses on the tangible and achievable and justifies on social and economic grounds
- The ex-minister, relaxed and willing to speak out

Agenda for action:
- widen the mandate by creating climate reponsibilities in departments and local regions
- involve people, such as with deliberative processes
- devising policies that grow support, such as around energy infrastructure, transport, divestment and a just transition
- consider the long term in institutional changes},

  comment          = {Prior to Covid pandemic, policies were becoming more mission-based by innovation bureaucracies were not and dynamic capabilities were illusive for most innovation bureaucracies.

We are witnessing both a normative turn towards framing innovation policies through specific challenges and an epistemic turn in innovation bureaucracies such as design, agile:
- prototyping
- experimentation
- action research
- ethnography 
- ``experiential, experimental and techno-solutionish `hacker' routines''

not so much:
- economics
- public policy analysis

Reemphasise that experimentalism is not enough, long-term capacities and dynamic capabilities matter - combination of dynamic functions and long-term stability-oriented functions seem to be at the heart of successful responses to the pandemic

Neo-Weberian agencies or Weber III-type agencies attempt to combine Weber I and II ... long-term legitimacy and professionalism ... expert organisations - while porosity to various stakeholder, epistemological and implementation frameworks ... charismatic networks

Proposed 5 ideal-types of innovation bureaucracy, all converging around neo-Weberian blueprints embodying agile-stability
- creators
- doers
- funders
- intermediaries
- rulers

Core missions of neo-Weberian innovation agencies:
1. Investment focussed missions and agencies
2. Market-shaping-focussed missions and agencies
3. System change or transformation-focussed missions and agencies

Modes to create and maintain long-term capacities and dynamic capabilities:
1. Leadership-driven - leaders supporting developing of capacities and capabilities
2. Management-driven - changing management practices and routines
3. New organisation-driven - new public organisation

GDS ``victim of its own success'' not stabilty-focussed. Now a need to renew sources and reasons driving dynamic capabilities},

Paper is about measuring in a dynamic sense 

Royal Charter and Agreement seeks to minimise negative impact of BBC on market but also sets expectation of BBC as market shaper

Evaluation layers:
- Direct i.e. baseline - static efficiency and consumption - e.g. viewing figures
- Dynamic e.g. spillovers and externalities - e.g. raised awareness/interest
- market shaping - ecosystem-wide dynamic efficiency - .e.g change in attitude or behaviour

Held a public value workshop at BBC of 13 stakeholders 

Refers to allocative efficiency SongS2018

Societal value includes informing as part of democratic process, representation of different cultures etc.

Industry value, especially Creative industries, de-risking and
crowding-in new actors 

Paper looks specifically at
- Content
- standards setting
- Talent
- Technology advances

Market shaping examples:
- Content
  - Blue Planet
  - Women in sport
- Standards
  - Editorial standards
  - Commissioning practice
  - TV, DAB, DVB-T2
- Talent
  - National Film and Television school
  - Most in sector worked or trained at BBC
- Technology
  - BBC Micro, iPlayer, BBC Sounds

Central to market shaping is directonality
Dynamic evaluation: burden of data collection minised by making it part of process of strategy-setting etc
Capture innovation spillovers, industry influence, ecosystem services, network effects (may require expensive in-depth studies)

For societal value: reach and cost per viewing among the less well served

Iterative evaluation and learning and adapting to feedback

Also suggest a portfolio approach to public value creation Market shaping: BBC as:
- Inventor
- Investor of first resort
- Innovator
- Platform

Consider what would be the counterfactual - what if there wasn't a BBC? 

Next steps:
- Produce a shared definition of dynamic public value, internally and externally
- Test how new evaluation methods align with the BBC's long-term strategy
- Develop dynamic data analytics capabilities within the BBC
- Start small and test the framework internally where there is appetite to do so
- Test the concept of dynamic public value and market shaping with Ofcom
- Feed early feedback from tests into the mid-term review},

  comment          = {``US federal government took a more central
role in steering and directing innovation ... about half of the public investments go into the military sector and half into the civilian sector, and of the civilian research only a small minority is funded on the basis of the linear or diffusion-oriented model, while the majority is funded to tackle the specific challenges of mission-oriented agencies (health, environment, energy, etc.)'' p97

Before second world war there was more borroing from Germany and UK p98

WWII therefore played role in establishment of research laboratories leading to parallel systems: ``the more politically legitimate military mission-oriented system (Weiss) and the less politically legitimate and more hidden generic economic growth and diffusion-oriented innovation system (Block and Keller) which have over time become increasingly interlinked p99

Weiss argues that dominant focus of the US federal technology and innovation policies has been on technology leadership `in order to sustain US military-political primacy, not to achieve commercial advantage' - national identity building

Innovation bureaucracy, self organising

Examples of different dynamic organisations within the US innovation bureaucracy p101-2, 108-12

DARPA evolved into an agile funder and intermediary rather than a doer or creator p103

Bonvillian identifies unique routines p104-5:
- small and flexible (only 100 programme managers)
- flat (non-hierachical)
- entrepreneurial (managers selected for industry/academic experience on 3-4 year terms)
- no laboratories
- Focus on impact not risk - DARPA projects are selected and evaluated on what impact they could make on achieving a demanding capability or challenge
- seed and scale (initial short terms funding that can scale or terminate)
- autonomy and freedom from bureaucratic impediments
- hybrid model (innovative firms and university researchers)
- teams and networks
- acceptance of failure
- orientation to revolutionary breakthroughs in a connected approach

Majority of research in US and Europe is funded by private sector (except Netherlands) p106

German science gained most from Marshall plan p107

Demise of mission-oriented policies and industrial planning due to emergence of EEC p112

Discussion of East Asia: Korea, Taiwan, SIngapore, Japan
Also Israel p113-6

Japan - MITI - movement of staff between here and other organisations which resulted in spread of ideas e.g. setting policy p116-7

too much autonomy leads to loss of control

finds:
one should not maximise trust but optimise it as a function of the cultural contingencies. Some distrust may even be functional and may create the tension necessary for a reform agenda

improving service delivery is necessary but not sufficient for trust. Good performance does not necessarily lead to more trust, but bad performance certainly will erode trust},

  abstract         = {Climate tipping points occur when change in a part of the climate system becomes self-perpetuating beyond a warming threshold, leading to substantial Earth system impacts. Synthesizing paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies, we provide a revised shortlist of global “core” tipping elements and regional “impact” tipping elements and their temperature thresholds. Current global warming of ~1.1°C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to \&lt;2°C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3°C of warming expected on current policy trajectories. This strengthens the evidence base for urgent action to mitigate climate change and to develop improved tipping point risk assessment, early warning capability, and adaptation strategies. Climate tipping points are conditions beyond which changes in a part of the climate system become self-perpetuating. These changes may lead to abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts with serious implications for humanity. Armstrong McKay et al. present an updated assessment of the most important climate tipping elements and their potential tipping points, including their temperature thresholds, time scales, and impacts. Their analysis indicates that even global warming of 1°C, a threshold that we already have passed, puts us at risk by triggering some tipping points. This finding provides a compelling reason to limit additional warming as much as possible. —HJS Global warming greater than 1.5°C could trigger multiple climate tipping points.},

  abstract         = {Leveraging artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on climate model output, we use the spatial pattern of historical temperature observations to predict the time until critical global warming thresholds are reached. Although no observations are used during the training, validation, or testing, the ANNs accurately predict the timing of historical global warming from maps of historical annual temperature. The central estimate for the 1.5\&nbsp;°C global warming threshold is between 2033 and 2035, including a ±1σ range of 2028 to 2039 in the Intermediate (SSP2-4.5) climate forcing scenario, consistent with previous assessments. However, our data-driven approach also suggests a substantial probability of exceeding the 2\&nbsp;°C threshold even in the Low (SSP1-2.6) climate forcing scenario. While there are limitations to our approach, our results suggest a higher likelihood of reaching 2\&nbsp;°C in the Low scenario than indicated in some previous assessments—though the possibility that 2\&nbsp;°C could be avoided is not ruled out. Explainable AI methods reveal that the ANNs focus on particular geographic regions to predict the time until the global threshold is reached. Our framework provides a unique, data-driven approach for quantifying the signal of climate change in historical observations and for constraining the uncertainty in climate model projections. Given the substantial existing evidence of accelerating risks to natural and human systems at 1.5\&nbsp;°C and 2\&nbsp;°C, our results provide further evidence for high-impact climate change over the next three decades.},

Government Interoperability and Data Exchange Platform GIDEP e.g.  GAIA-X within the EU or Estonia's X-Road

Create an initial typology and suggest a lot more research is required

Different types:
Centralised data storage (CDS) <-> decentralised data storage (DDS)
Centralised data exchange (CDE) <-> decentralised data exchange (DDE)

Discovered configurations:
CDS+CDE, DDS+CDE and DDS+DDE

No GIDEPs in UK, US, Australia, NZ or Sweden - although clear desire in these countries and often API registries and guidelines

Gives further insights into these other countries including South Korea, Uruguay, Spain, Singapore, Switzerland, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Netherlands, Norway and Portugal

``In most cases these legal frameworks specified a single interoperability platform that must be used for the exchange of data, the standards and technologies associated with exchanging data on this platform are mandated, citizen consent for the exchange of personal information must be sought and recorded, and, increasingly, citizens should not be asked for their data more than once (the once only principle).''

Almost all G2G, G2C only by a citizen portal - not reduction in innovative potnetial of legal framework, security and technology

Commonly occurring building blocks:
- essential:
  - identity management
  - trust
  - digital  services
  - data management
  - secure data exchange
- statistics and monitoring (only in a few GIDEPs):
  - event-based  processing
  - payment  processing
  - messaging  and communications
  - data analytics

Continuum of interoperability: from no data exchange and low generativity to fully interoperable ecosystem with high generativity

From closed source, enterprise based, and self-hosted to  cloud based, open source, and utilizes a microservice architecture

3 innovations that are likely to become increasingly important:
- MyData
- consent management
- the once only  principle

MyData  is  a  concept  that  envisages  handing  back  control  over  data  to  citizens,  creating  new opportunities  for individuals  to  exercise  control over  the  data  and how  it is used \url{https://www.mydata.org/participate/declaration/}

Creates need for e.g. consent register for consent of the user to exchange data about them with another government organization

Once only principle requires a mapping of data resources amongst government organizations and must contain modules that allow for real time data querying and update},

  comment          = {Performance has become a fixation of governments

This paper identifies a new ideal type performance governance trend made up of:
- organizational relationships both within and beyond the public sector that cover a range of collaborations governed by performance mechanisms
- participation and citizen engagement including community performance feedback
- integration of performance across several levels
- societal impacts as demonstrated by performance and managed by performance controlled implementation and service delivery

This work conceives governance as encompassing governments responsible for making decisions on public policy as well as being responsive to external preferences and incorporating interactions with citizens and civil society

Performance is more expressly national and societal with focus from improving processes and outputs to results and impacts - indicators are linked to endeavours and objectives

These are combined in the broad stands of thinking:
- joined up Government, while if government, horizontal management etc
- engagement with citizens in performance measurement and evaluation 

Move to New Public Governance, more pluralistic approach to government with multiple inter-dependent actors 

Shift from governing of performance to governing for performance

The ultimate purpose of governing performance is to increase public value

Components: networks, ICT, PPPs, Shared Service Centres, direct contributions fun citizens and public participation

Goes on to discuss how performance is measured and that this is difficult (probably impossible, possibly useful) especially with all the interconnections and the need to measure outcomes. Also social capital is important and social capital is linked to trust.

Increasing importance of measuring impact

Cities are more complex and penetration testing would require agreement across many organisations

Different systems have vulnerabilities electronic road signs, lifts, utilities

It takes coordination to bring down a city

``True chaos requires an understanding of the interconnectivity between the different critical and non-critical infrastructure sectors''

However, even freak events can take it multiple systems so understanding the interconnectedness is necessary to overcome these incidents quickly

DPI that led to good outcomes in covid-19 pandemic: p7
- were already widely used by people and organizations across whole countries or sectors
- had basic, powerful and broadly applicable functionality
- enabled functions of core societal importance; regulated or
managed by the government

Digital public goods DPGs to be built on top of DPIs

DPI examples:
- Digital identity
- Digital payments
- Data exchanges

Defines ``good'' DPI:
- Commonality and interoperability
- Openness
- Inclusion and equity
- Integrity and security
- Sustainability and iteration
- Competition and public agency
- Transparency, accountability, and redress
- Legitimate public and private use of data
- Protection of rights and privacy

Highlights 6 areas:
1. A vision for digital public infrastructure as a whole, backed by practice, research, and evaluation.
2. A global commons based on digital public goods.
3. Safeguards for inclusion, trust, competition, security, and privacy.
4. Tools that use data in digital public infrastructure for public value and private empowerment.
5. Private and public capacity, particularly in implementing countries.
6. Silo-busting, built-for-purpose coordinating, funding, and financing.

Identified use cases:
1. pandemic response, public health and healthcare delivery
2. social protection
3. on-ramp to the digital economy
4. engine for effective, accessible and accountable government
5. platform for future innovations for education, climate, energy access and other challenges

Examples:
- Togo - Emergency Cash Transfers for the Most Vulnerable, included geospatial data and ML to predict consumption patterns
- DHIS2 (District Health Information Software 2) - now serves 30\% of the world population
- Estonia - X-Road



Characteristics shared by DPIs:
* Diversity of impact, with a variety of use, users, and problems that can be applied 
* Network effects, which create more value as more people and places connect—but can also  create natural monopolies    
* Integrative, meaning that the value of DPI grows as new functions are built “on top” 
* Universal, with functions that are fairly similar across sectors and borders 
* Human-facing, used by people  in their social, economic,  and physical context  
* Evolving, with a need to be  continually improved (not just  maintained) as technology and society changes 
* Ubiquitous, with a tendency to become de facto prerequisites  for modern governance and  commerce, making it difficult to opt-out of their use 
* Data generating, potentially  creating detailed information  about users and their activities  and interactions},

Chapter 2 AUTOMATING ELIGIBILITY IN THE HEARTLAND about Sophie Stipes who has cerebral palsy and her family (and other cases) who lost Medicaid when public service systems were automated in Indiana. 

Sophie's Medicaid was cut off because her mother was unable to fill out the extensive forms when four of the family became ill. Mother asked for help but decisions no longer make at local level. Letter to 6 year old Sophie saying Medicaid that she needed to survive would be cut off because she'd ``failed to co-operate''. 

The corporations now processing the claims were poorly trained, overwhelmed, under resourced and incentivised by the number of cases processed, and so returning a case as ``failed to co-operate''

Chapter 3 HIGH-TECH HOMELESSNESS IN THE CITY OF ANGELS

Chapter 4 THE ALLEGHENY ALGORITHM about the Allegheny Family Screening Tool. Gives a more positive spin than Kitzmiller2014. Twenty-nine different programs—including adult probation, the bureau of drug and alcohol services, the housing authority, the county jail, the juvenile probation office, the Allegheny County police department, the state office of income maintenance, the office of mental health and substance abuse services, the office of unemployment compensation, and almost 20 local school districts—send regular data extracts. 

Discusses the opacity of ``risk scores'' given to children by the algorithm.  Notes that staff in the call centre are more likely to adjust their view of the case according the algorithm's score than the other way round. Also, referral bias rather than screening bias because calls to hotlines are more likely to be about black and biracial children despite it being a country with majority white children. Vast majority of families involved with Children, Youth and Families service CYF are working class or poor. 

``AFST interprets the use of public resources as a sign of weakness, deficiency, even villainy.''. Since validation data for actual abuse was very rare, proxies for abuse needed to be created which included those who were screened - and screening could have occurred because of a malicious call to a hotline.

Conclusion: Dismantling the poorhouse

Describes how the ambitions of Martin Luther King to end racism and poverty have still not been realised, although there are movements attempting to address this. Discusses the potential of Universal Basic Income UBI.

``poverty is not an island; it is a borderland. There's quite a lot of movement on the economic fringes, especially across the fuzzy boundary between the poor and the working class. Those who live in the economic borderlands are pitted against one another...''

Questions to check that harm is minimised:
Does the tool increase the self-determination and agency of the poor?
Would the tool be tolerated if it was targeted at non-poor people?

Infrasture may be build skillfully but do not provide breadth of understanding

Language limits and constrains thought

ODI Data Skills Framework - includes change management, essential if rebalancing power

John Rawls maximin principle - society should maximise the welbeing of those at the most minimal level - based on idea of designing society before you know your place in it

Achille Mbembe Critique of Black Reason - idea of the becoming black in the world - in another time people who's skin colour is black may be in power, previous the Irish experience "blackness". Significance of skin colour has changed. What does this mean in the maximin principle.

The fragility of power - power could be subject to reversal

Knowledge of this fragility means living with humility

Critical question: What kind of data infrastructure would we require if we applied the maximin principle

How would we use data and digital technology if rules could be reversed at any time

  comment          = {Discussion of how states simplify by brute force (forestry, roads, clearances, naming conventions) or by representations (mapping, aerial photography) the world for their own control (tax, conscription, repression). Main theme is of High Modernism.

Interesting table on p220 comparing the illegible with the legible in terms of settlements, economic unites, property regimes and more

Isiah Berlin's Study of Tolstoy distinguishing hedgehog, who know one thing, with fox, who knew many things p45-6 [this is also discussed in Nate Silver's The Signal and the Noise].

A great description of German Scientific Forestry which attempted to bring order to forests with ultimately disastrous consequences p11-22

Cadastral mapping, which was carried out for the purpose of collecting taxs etc,  emerged earlier where civil society was weakest (and the state comparitively stronger). France before England p49

Aerial view/photograph allow a miniaturisation of the landscape p57-8

Comprehensive Dutch citizen registration allowed Nazi occupation to discover distribution of Jews in the Netherlands p78

Manufacture of standardised facts: p80
- creation of standardised units
- counting/measuring/application of these units
- aggregation of values to draw out new fact
Precision of standardisation is more important than accuracy p81
Standardisation makes land and population easier to mintor, count, assess, manage p81-2

Uniformity and order are largely a project on internal colonisation, civilising. Not just observing but shaping people and landscape p82

Error has more power than omission [see the introduction to PeetersW2018]. Population must dance to the authority's tune p83

High modernism can be described as a process: p91-3
- discovery of society
- measurement of society
- improvement of society
- because there is a perfectibility of society
Modernism is flux is disorientation and leads to the streamlining and reduction of friction to change p93

``The troubling features of high modernism derive ... from its claim to speak about the improvement of the human condition with the authority of scientific knowledge and its tendency to disallow for other competing sources of judgement'' p93

``A key characteristic of discourses of high modernism and of the public pronouncements of those states that have embraced it is a heavy reliance on visual images of hoeroic progress toward a totally transformed future" p95

There is also more sympathic view of high modernism that is that health can be improved by planning and transportation p96

Chapter 4 on the High Modernist City featuring Paris, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janiero, Brasilia is fascinating

Le Corbusier, architect (?) influenced Lucio Costa to design Brasilia. There are not bustling streets or social conviality. Identified a trauma in the first residents p126 

Irony between macro-order and micro-confusion p127

``the planners of the utopian city, whose goal is more to change the world than to accommodate it, howver the shock and disorientation ocasioned by life in Brasilia may be part of its didactic purpose'' p127

Brasilia is scientific forestry p125

Public order doesn't require state or police but a density of people on ``sidewalk terms'', interested in the busy urbanmixed space and each other p135-6 - Jane Jacobs' observation that visual order does not create social order p135

``it is beyond the scope of anyone's imagination to create a community'' Stanley Tankel p144

Lenin, saw the Vanguard Party's relation to working class is like capitalist entrepreneurs' relation to the working class - that the working class is necessary to production and its members much be trained, instructed, organised efficiently by professional specialists p156 

Lenin's vision is miltaristic, mass exercises p156, p170

Rosa Luxenburg was critical of Lenin's ideas. Used symbolism from nature and the complexity of organisms. Also the capacity of teachers to learn from students. She was deeply impressed by the autonomous popular initiatives happening all over Russia. p171
She expressed that to dissect the workers movement was to kill it p172

Kollontay's criticism of Lenin is also of the suppression of worker creativity and that this smothers moral and creative spirit. ``The end result was an arbitrary, myopic layer of officials presiding over a dispirited workforce putting in a ``bad-faith'' day on the factory floor'' p177

``The way the trip is made is at least a important as the destination'' p179
``a vanguard part cna achieve its revolutionary results in a way that defeat its central prupose'' p179

The concept of state-spaces and non-state-spaces. The state is much more able to appropriate labour etc in the former and so would-be rulers create and then expand state-space by building irrigation, capturing subjects in wars, forcing settlement, codifying religions, etc. p186

Edmund Leech described Burma as a set of horizontal slices through the topography in which the valleys with wet rice are state spaces, above these is shifting sparse cultivation where the population interacts with the state space, and above this still is non-state-space p186

There is a paradox that plantations are less productive than smallholdings but are encouraged by the state - because they are easier to know, tax etc p189-90

Massive scale farming arose from an exchange of ideas between US an Russia in 1920s. The context of this was different and so it didn't do so well p199-201

Soviet collectivisation was forced, violent and caused famine and millions of deaths p202-210

The agricultural and econmic failure could be seen as a success in terms of the state having oversight and control p203

Social custom of the village is replace with state building p214

Soviet collectivisms outcomes included: p217-9
- turning autonmous peasants into unfree labourers
- central planning which is unresponsive to local knowledge or conditions
- no incentive to adapt to or negotiate with local subjects

Tanzanian villagisation has similarities to authoritarian high modernism: P224-5
1. idea of `improving' e.g. c.f. `unimproved forest'
2. reorganise human communities to enable easier control
3. Aesthetic dimension that emerges - faith in visual order

Villagisation failed economically and ecologically - if population is hostile, effecient practices can be made ineffecient p225

``dustbowls are common features in situations where human initiatives has suddently overtaxed the carrying capacity of the land'' p235

Tanzania would have been worse if not for a level of truculance and a also weak government p247

Ethiopiean villagisation - Marxist/socialist regime using military to resettle. Loss of knowledge of a local land, commuity and ability to grow a mix of crops contributed to the famine in the 1980s p251

Changing an organisation structure is easier than changing its operation p255 General point about changing what is easy rather than what is required/useful/etc

Planning produces thin results - thin villages, city, etc. A ``dark twin'' can emerge to account for all the other components that would have existed in a thick counterpart p260 (a bit like Shadow IT in Schwartz)

The necessarily simple abstractions of large bureaucratic institutions can never adequatly represent the actual complexity of natuinal and social processes p262

Visual order is not working order p275

I think this raises the question about the value of science for application that are necessarily diverse [really interesting, is this similar to the arguments against using RCT for social science?] p288

Work-to-rule actions cause work to grind to a halt or go at snail's pace because work processes depend heavily on informal understandings and improvisation p310

Metis - ability that is learned by doing (my words). Activities that require Metis are difficult to teach without doing. Example from Odysseus who had ability to adapt and capacity to understand. p313

Metis is contextual, ``traditional'', plastic and drifts p332

Techne is technical knowledge precise and universal p320

I mention this book in comments on Gladwell2000

No rules of Techni or Episteme can explain scientific invention and insight [innovation] - this perhaps requires Metis p320

Techne is most suitable to activities that have singular ... quantitative measurement - referencing Nussbaum Fragility of Goodness (p99) p322

Jenner's smallpox innoculation followed cultural knowledge and practise of variolation [vaccine] p325-6

Stephen Marglin: ``if the only certainty about the future is that the future is uncertain, if the only sure thing is that we are in for surprises, then no amount of planning, not mount of prescription, can deal with the contingencies that the future will reveal'' [Agile] p244

Aldo Leopold ``the first rule of intelligent thinking is to keep all the parts'' [ecology, ecosystem] p345

Even the market is dependent on a larger system of social relations which it does not acknowledge. Laws, power, trust, commumity, cooperation p351

Herman and Daly 1996: the economy is ``a subsystem of a finite and nongrowing eco-system'' p351

``metis to the rescue'' ... nonconforming practice is an indepensable condition for formal order p352

Complex systems have redundancy, resilieance and stability. My inference - simplifications would already have occurred where this would still maintain these three qualities p353},

e.g. state registration of cars that led to victim of car theft being repeatedly fined for not having her car tested - because a human component of the information chain (to inform victim that the car had been found) had failed

being excluded from the system also means being excluded from public services

argue that both citizens and street-level bureaucrats are caught up in a `digital cage' - a wordplay on Weber's `iron cage' (Weber, 2006a: 201) signifying not the disciplining logic of bureaucratic rules, but of information architecture. ``The iron cage refers to a situation in which people, in their desire for predictability and control, become increasingly trapped in expanding bureaucratic structures that subject human behaviour to rules and procedures, and reduce humans to cogs in a machine'' ``In a digital cage, bureaucrats are incapable of making value decisions''

There are few barriers to errors entering the system but many for its correction. [Error has more power than omission in Scott2020].

This article makes two contributions to our current understanding of e-government. First, it makes the ethical dimensions of classifications, algorithmic decision-making, and data-sharing explicit by applying the framework of administrative burdens. second, we apply a critical perspective to an emerging information technology in e-government.

Could be useful for methodology

Similar case studies in the Netherlands to the US ones in Eubanks2019

Mechanisms of exclusion:
- The system is a black box for citizens and bureaucrats
- The system produces `legal contamination via ICT'
- The system eliminates street-level discretion
- The system creates perverse behavioural incentives

Citizens and bureaucrats are forced to work within the instrumental rationality of the information architecture},

``meither the have-nots nor the powerholders  are homogeneous blocs. Each group encompasses a host of divergent points of view, significant cleavages, competing vested interests, and splintered subgroups. The justification for using such simplistic abstractions is that in most cases the have-nots really do perceive the powerful as a  monolithic ``system,'' and powerholders actually do view the have-nots as a sea of ``those people,'' with little comprehension of the dass and caste differences among them'' p217

`` the typology does not include an analysis of the most  significant roadblocks to achieving genuine  levels of participation. These roadblocks lie on both sides of the simplistic fence. On the power-holders'  side, they include racism, paternalism,  and resistance to power redistribution. On the have-nots' side, they include inadequacies of the poor community's political socioeconomic infrastrudure and knowledge-base, plus difficulties of organizing a representative and accountable  citizens' group in the face of futility, alienation, and distrust.'' p217},

During the deliberations, jurors considered information about data-driven technologies used during the pandemic, heard from a range of experts and took part in facilitated discussions. They expressed their concerns and suggested criteria for the good governance of data and data-driven technologies.

1. Transparency, communication and clarity: there must be clear and consistent communication around the use of data-driven approaches, and application of rules and public health measures during a pandemic.
2. Accountability: there must be emphasis on adherence to the rule of law, protecting democracy and ensuring robust, fair and equal enforcement of policies.
3. Equity, inclusiveness and non-discrimination: the use of data-driven technologies should not exacerbate unequal social stratification or create a two-tiered society.
4. Protection of personal freedoms: use of data-driven technologies should respect and protect individual liberties and rights.
5. Proportionate and time-limited uses: data use must balance public health needs and risks to individuals and society, and pandemic response measures must not extend into post-pandemic data futures.
6. Emergency preparedness and planning: effective, accurate and responsibly managed data should be the basis for evidence and learning during emergency preparedness and planning.
7. Trustworthiness: the organisations and governance structures involved in the design and use of a data-driven technology must be trustworthy.

Wheel of good governance:
- Consensus orientated
- Accountable
- Transparent
- Responsive
- Equitable and inclusive
- Effective and efficient
- Follows the rule of law
- Participatory},

Chapter 6: considers the work of Wampler and applies QCA to test Wampler's claims. Find that there isn't enough consistency to make claims about necessity advisable. Concludes that necessity claims are premature and overblown.

Political leader's support seems to be the only necessary condition, but it's not sufficient p198

``Where civil society retains autonomy and acts both in contention and concert with willing political leaders, and bureaucratic staff are able and willing to support the process, this combination of factors is sufficient for success, regardless of financial challenges'' p198

Citizens assembly took place in 2015 on how Hampshire and Isle of Wight should be governed. There was a similar one based in Sheffield. Part of research to understand how participatory democracy could work.

Based on a proposal for devolution of the area. Health and social care not included in this proposal but came out as a strong recommendation by the assembly.

``demonstrated that regular citizens are ready, willing and able to engage with complex policy and governance debates when given appropriate support and opportunity''

This (Southampton / HIOW) assembly included politician in the delegates, the Sheffield one did not. There was a difference between the two in that that participants noted some more dominant voices in HIOW discussions at the start which wasn't strongly noted in Assembly North. 

Recruitment:
* Around 4000 people received initial survey and asked if interested in citizens' assembly - without any indication about what this would be about
* Those who showed interested asked if they could attend at proposed dates
* Initial survey responses were used to select a stratified random sample of attendees from those with ability to attend
* Local councillors also selected

23 of 31 citizens and 6 of 14 councillors who said they'd attend did attend on the first weekend. 

It is unclear why local councillors were not good at attending

Gives details of the structure of the assembly, each sessions purpose and size of group. `Witness speed dating' whereby witnesses presented their case in 5 minutes to small groups of participants seemed to create more engagement than more traditional approach (witnesses present for 5 to everyone, then small groups generate questions).

Participants were able to propose topics for Open Space on final day.

Notes that participants need to be treated well, requires a lot of volunteers, costs of accommodation and food

  comment          = {What is it that parliament can't do that a citizens assembly can do?

(Professor David Farrell, School of Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin): Knows about previous CA on abortion and same-sex marriange in Ireland. CA - is a mini-public, at request of parliament, there to advise and help parliament . Well-run process brings citizens up to speed. Open transparaent process, expert advisory group with unimpeachable credentials. Balance of views in experts (gives example of abortion discussion in Ireland). Strong need for cross-party buy-in (this was present in Irish case).  Referendum vote in Ireland had very similar proportion to outcomes of citizens assembly. Large part of role of citizens assembly is to educate the political and media classes - politicians and journalists became informed in a way they hadn't been informed before. Irish process took 2-3 months to set up, 5 months to deliberate, 3 months or so for parliamentary committee to deliberate on outcome. Wider public were aware of the CA. A weakness of the process was that agenda was too broad - recommends focussing on one or two issues. Chair chosen carefully to keep discussion on track. Advocates were brought into the process as advocates. Political class appreciate being able to learn from experts. Important that its clear from beginning what would happen to the output of the assembly.

(Sarah Allan, Head of Engagement, Involve):  Knows about a previous CA on Brexit. CA representative of wider population - in attitude as well as demographic characteristics. Participants should know when there is an imbalance in range of views because this may matter to them personally. Pure sortition is a civic lottery - random selection initially and use respones to this to select representative assembly.  CAs shouldn't be used if not looking at public judgement but rather a specific part of the population. Not a good idea if they don't have sufficient support. Could do something meaningful to provide guidance in 3 or 4 weekends. Time to prepare in 2 months but with very quick sign off by parliament. Doesn't include procurement process. Haven't had problems getting representative range of citizens. Discussion is structured to keep on track. Participants not able to engage with social media, lobby groups etc during the events. Participants loved the process of learning from and questioning experts - always one of the favourite parts. Needs to be commissioned by Gov or Parliament. Important to have high media profile. Important also to get clear what the question is.

(Dr Alan Renwick, Deputy Director, Constitution Unit, UCL): Where parliament has found it difficult to find a solution. Shows that there is public support. Witnesses with range of perspectives and assured balance with advisory board who had a range of positions (including neutral). Ideally 5 or 6 weekends to deliberate - ideally spaced out so that people 3 or 4 week intervals because people are often not available for consecutive weekends. Suggests double-referendum process - one on principle and one on proposal, with CA in advance on either e.g. considers that there should have been a CA before the point of priciple referendum. Participants learn a lot from each other, experts inputs isn't everything. Some participants thought it may be a hoax before the start. Participants wanted their involvement to have impact. 

Participants on Brexit CA were told when there is an imbalance in expert opinion -


Discussion of citizen assembly on Brexit - had some interesting findings like little appetite for no deal Brexit and appetite for staying in single market.

Polarisation can be overcome, but needs political buy-in

CA in Ireland deliberated on the referendum question.

Confidentiality - different approaches, can be decided by the participants. Can just publish the demographic breakdown. 

Important:
- commissioned by government or parliament
- high media profile
- clear question
- clarity from start what would happen to the output of the assembly - participants want impact
- confidentiality and protection for particpants

- Most people in the UK expressed broad satisfaction with democracy, but had very little trust  in politicians.
- Most people wanted politicians who are honest, have integrity, and operate within the rules.
- People generally preferred not to concentrate power in the hands of a few politicians, but to spread  it to parliament, non-politicians, and the public.
- Most people showed notably higher support for judicial interventions than is often supposed.
- Most people thought that people like themselves had too little influence. But many were reluctant  to get actively involved themselves.
- There was support for mechanisms such as referendums (though often relatively muted) and for citizens' assemblies.
- Conceptions of democracy varied across the population, and were related particularly to attitudes on Brexit and partisanship. But it is important not to exaggerate these differences. On key points there was widespread and high agreement.

People trust government's scientific advisors much more than politicians

Politicians should be honest and act with integrity (the latter defined 

Importance of politicians characters from most to least:
- be honest
- own up when they make mistakes
- be in rouch with ordinary people
- keep their promises
- listen to a wide range of views
- explain their actions and decisions
- follow the rules
- have a clear vision for what they want to do
- get things done
- set a good example on their private life
- work hard
- think independently
- have had a job outside politics
- be inspiring
- be clever

Most people thought that people have too little influence in how UK is governed. More than 50\% support citizens' assemblies for difficult political issues.

Interesting results on BBC - it seems that more people think that the BBC should be more critical of the government than less critical, and the converse is even more the case - that many more people disagree that the BBC should be less critical of government that think should not be more critical.},

Gives background about why Centre for Governance and Scrutiny (CfGS) was commissioned  to undertake ``a light touch review'' of governance practice at SCC over Winter 2021/2

Main reason for report seems to be the 20221-2022 administration's frustration with the slowness of governance response of officers to their needs. 

The report author and his team at CfGS, took a critical friend approach (against the national picture of best practice) using:
- interviews with a cross section of members and officers
- survey of members and officers
- consideration of several case studies
- consideration of the Council's Constitution and pre-agenda publication procedures
- consideration of the training and development offer 

Draft completed in Spring 2022 and was updated in September to account for responses from Group Leaders. Final version is Hammond2022 - see my entry on this for more detail and recommendations.

``In a learning organisation, not least one under political control which can, and does change, one key matter all officers and members need to be acutely aware of are the pressures that brings, be better prepared in advance on both sides and to be more fleetfooted in delivery of manifesto commitments subject of course to adhering to the lawfulness of those proposals, their affordability at a time of great budget pressures, principles of good governance, probity and ethics.''},

This report seeks to identify where changes can be made to effect improvements in governance systems at Southampton City Council (SCC).

Administration that came in to SCC in May 2021 expected to be able to move swiftly with their plans but ``leading councillors felt a sense of impatience with officers, and existing systems, which it saw as holding up the need to act quickly and decisively''

Some evidence that this occurred with previous administration too.

As a result, members (councillors) had sometimes responded poorly to, or ignored officers' advice and requested it removed from reports. ``officer reports were written defensively and where some interviewees suggested that risks, or negative consequences, of taking certain decisions in certain ways were downplayed''

Finds that ``there are no fundamental and systemic flaws in the council's governance framework overall ... improvements relate to tackling relationships rather than undertaking fundamental revisions of processes, structures and systems''

``officers do not seem to have engaged consistently with ... members' priorities ... this may have started with a lack of planning before the 2021 election to understand how priorities would need to shift if there was a change in administration''

Low quality reports:
- tended not not contain details of policy options
- low quality equality impact assessments
Report considers that a lot of these shortcomings due to the pace of decision-making
Also 
- legal advice sought too late
- heavy use of call-in

Actions include:
- mandatory training for all councillors on member and officer roles
- mandatory workshops for senior officers on the skills and expertise needed to operate in a political environment
- revisit the format and content of office r reports},

Women's liberation moved from consciousness-raising to other tasks because education is not longer so much needed as the principle of women's liberation was well known

Women's liberation movement -  great emphasis has been placed on what are called leaderless, structureless groups as the main form of the movement.

``A 'laissez-faire' group is about as realistic as a 'laissez-faire' society; the idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others.''

does not prevent the formation of informal structures, but only formal ones.

structurelessness is a way of masking power

rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few

for every to be involved, the structure must be explicit

Goes on to paint a picture of the elite and especially the elite in the women's movement - which is exclusive of certain groups

Great description of needing time to cultivate relationships to join in the elite

Women's movement has not identified official `spokespeople' but has `stars' who do not represent any group or established opinion of the movement. These people are often used by the media to speak `for' the movement. The consequences can be back for the movement or the `stars'.

Structure is useful for getting things done - more than `just talking'

Some women leave because they don't want to start their own projects and can't find ones they want to join - they join other political movements

The more structured groups are the only ones able to launch national campaigns

Principles:
1. delegation of specific authority
2. responsibility of those with delegated authority to those who selected them
3. distribution of authority to as many as reasonably possible
4. rotation of tasks among individuals
5. allocation of tasks along rational criteria

the `real law' is the law that is applied, not something in a statute book

Important points about public policy

1. public policy is what is implemented not what is formally declared (real speed limits are often higher, black and white, rich and poor, etc drivers have different traffic laws). Discretion of how law is exercised raises questions:
a. need to hold agents to account for how they exercise law?
b. what extent does discretion affect outcomes for citizens?
c. what type of employees would most likely provide high quality inclusive services?
d. how outmoded is the idea that law bounds street level?

Decisions being made are political

Street-level bureaucrats are both effectors and detectors ... a feed-back approach to policy-making.

the question remains whether the service providers attempt to achieve equality in service delivery or attempt to cater more to the particular needs of each client

citizens ... appear to want the law applied equally, except to them.

Representative bureaucracy - for the representatives of the state to also represent the range of citizens. Idea of active representation whereby members of the public bureaucracy represent people in their gender, class, etc (``Otherwise, why are they there?'' :-o) 

``political representative bureaucracy, coupled with discretion at the `bottom-end' levels of government, can produce the ultimate allocative decisions by government''

Policy drift can occur due to decisions at bottom of organisations - informal patterns of decision-making

options:
- `tamper-proof legal instruments'
- what must be done to make the law work in real-world circumstances.

Arguments for shift to AI:
- create equality of treatment - same outcomes for similar cases
- make better decisions because they can process more data

``better decisions'' are better for whom?

The relative robustness of the so-called `Gentofte model' may stimulate its diffusion in countries sharing key elements of the Scandinavian model and inspire municipalities in other countries to experiment with the development of hybrid democracy.

  comment          = {Discuss a Danish case that developed hybrid approach to democracy that combined representative democracy with participatory and deliberative democracy

One of the case studies drawn on by Scottish Government to review how citizens participate \url{https://www.gov.scot/publications/systems-local-governance-citizens-participate-international-review/pages/9/}

Although our findings may be difficult to generalize due to the particularity of the strong, consensus-based Scandinavian  democracies,  they  may  stimulate  future  attempts to reinvigorate the institutions of local democracy where elected politicians tend to suffer from: 
1. tunnel vision due to their narrow focus on case-processing in sector-specific permanent committees
2. decoupling due to their limited opportunities for engaging in policy formulation that is dominated by public managers
3. insulation due to their limited contact with lay-actors that can help them to understand policy problems and inspire them to find new solutions (Kjær \& Opstrup 2016)

``Inspired by Tocqueville, Barber (1984) recommended a further strengthening  of  democratic  participation.  He  calls  representative  democracy  a  `thin'  democracy  because  people  are  too  far  removed  from  their  elected  representatives and lack insight into and ownership of collective decisions and the necessity that they embody.''

From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Democracy}{Wikipedia}:``Winning a mass election is normally a function of how much money is used for advertisement, and, thus, results in a rule by oligarchs, or plutocracy,''

``distinguish `conventional participation' in public  meetings  and  hearings  and  `thin  participation'  in  crowd-sourcing  and  crowd-funding  activities  from  `thick  participation'  involving  group-based  interaction that enables people to learn, decide and act together (Nabatchi \&  Leighninger  2015,  14-22)'' p28

Lists merits and problems of both reprentative and participatory and deliberative democracy. Examples:
``Helps to construct a `we' and thus to counteract individualistic atomization and group-based fragmentation''
``Spurs the production of innovative solutions by stimulating processes of mutual and transformative learning''
``Builds joint ownership over new and bold solutions that helps to ensure their implementation''

Task Committees are formed with a mix of ~20 politicians, citizens and stakeholders.

``Task Committees are regulated by a mandate drafted and approved by  the  City  Council.  The  mandate  defines  the  policy  problem  in  broad  terms, describes its background and the existing policies, and specifies the type of delivery (a vision, strategy, action plan, policy proposal or initiative) that the Task Committee is expected to submit to the City Council, which will then discuss, amend and endorse it in an ordinary meeting.''

``The picture from the case studies is that this kind of participation has limited influence over local decision-making. Such experiences are disempowering, and in case studies have led to disengagement by communities. Opportunities for participation that are not at the discretion of governance bodies, and for which the results are binding, are more likely to advance levels of engagement. This is likely too with opportunities for citizen initiated participation, which are much rarer'' p12},

Participatory, deliberative politics for dealing with grievance politics around flashpoints

Examples:
Italian regions have legal frameworks for participation. This started in Tuscany (although recently this has stopped). They had an independent authority of public participation practitioners and a running budget to do participation and competitions - find out more about this process. See also Emilia-Romagna and Scicily.
Ireland - About a third of the assembly was politicians. The citizens assembly was probably necessary but not sufficient to enable same sex marriage vote.
British Columbia original assembly incorporated a process by which members of the assembly returned to their communities between meetings to enable diffusion. The first meeting was a learning phase and then this learning was taken back to community. Responses of community was then fed back to next assembly meeting. 
European model - seems to be mainly about mini-publics than diffusion.
Assembly South/North closer to citizens jury, cheaper model, \href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j6382AQAAAAJ&hl=en}{James Fishkin} considered opinion poll, this is probably the model that NGOs are implementing regularly
Oregon - citizens initiative review - people put initiative on ballot - initiative review with about 40 citizens interviewing witnesses - put recommendations and dissenting view in card to every voter. Citizens were found to have remained interested after getting involved.
Scotland - look into more, e.g. consultation on gender recognition act - this was done well. They work with Citizens Foundation in Iceland, decidim 
French Grand Debate people were found to have stayed interested after being involved

\href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V_ng11gAAAAJ&hl=en}{Stephanie McNulty} found that putting Participatory Budgeting in law doesn't seem to work - civil society in Brazil pushed from bottom up wanted to keep it informal and not captured by gov but this may be weakness. However, there's still a lot of trial and error.

Southampton case:
Southampton climate assembly 
Getting political leaders on side is easier than council staff
Trying to apply British Colombia model
Officers may feel they are being asked to do too much with too little budget
Needs an entrepreneur bureaucrat in the council
Needs either more money, or get right actors in place - basis of Matt's book what combinations of actors
Hoping to wrap up in a year
Ideally a meeting in every ward of the city - engage people who are currently disengaged. 
No project manager yet
Youth Jury in schools on the back of assembly 
Separate project with SoCAN - building a network through this - doing some meetings
Kaur currently very supportive of participatory democracy process

Needs leadership
Charismatic leadership that is committed to participation
Reliant on political entrepreneurs
Lots of innovative different approaches may work better than one option
Civil servants needs people who see this as most important part of their job - without this its much more difficult. e.g. create a department who does the participation aspect like in Tuscany - helps because it a focal point
Can survive with a bit of inertia for a year or two but needs someone to drive forward from political point of view. Process needs to drive to implementation eventually. E.g. someone staking political reputation on it. 

3 types of participation
1. run of the mill consultation
more innovative options:
2. mass social media - channels demands of civil society - but more combative
3. deliberative model

Doesn't work if partisan
socialisation in safe space
permanency
question about how to connect with the policy space
its not about process but people! civil servant leader.
`Climate Assembly' already alienates people who aren't interested in climate
Big advocate for rotation
Ideally build up dense civil society around participatory democracy.
From PB book - social movements are often triggers of bottom up pb but its possible for it be top down. In this case civil society is less dense and it can still work (my impression is, for a while) 
There is a pressure for leaders to constantly innovate - so even if PB has been successful, it can be thrown out or changed by new administration
Sortition-based is starting to get criticism because they do quota sampling and response rates are really low but claim is that people who response are similar to MPs and very engaged politically already},

Tension between empirical study and normative projects.

There is a dearth of studies on deliberative processes that have failed, especially in top journals

How to define ``success'' - if survival (of the democratic process) is the basic characteristic then there are few successes

Discussion of definition of the cases in the field - if they are being defined on the grounds of being innovative this makes them difficult to group into a single class, since by definition they must be unique

Normative projects may presuppose that democratic innovation is needed and if the empirical work has arisen from this their is influence on the study itself - the tension between empirical and normative is too weak

``Failures will simply not be as salient where a class is defined by solutionist claims'' - if it failed it is not a member of the class we are looking at

Tensions can also be too strong between empirical and normative study - what if evidence falsifies hypothesis. Risk that failures are characteristed as non-deliberation

Calls for work to look at what produces democratic goods in different contexts and less on trying to define deliberative

Notes that the field of democratic innovation is competitive and there are perverse incentives, in terms of academic survival, results are not portrayed as negative or to risk reputation

Publication bias is that ``findings'' are published. If there isn't much found, this is not published

Short review of case studies including:
- Participedia which is gatherthing knowledge from all participatory efforts, from the participants themselves and mapping their characteristics
- Empatia has an embargo approach that means communication strategy has a few months to be prepared to manage potential negative outcomes from information being released},

``use of reserves to such an extent also compromises the capacity for `invest to save' and to achieve savings through transformation work''

1. Empowering Communities 
2. Supporting Businesses 
3. Active and Sustainable Travel 
4. Low Emission Vehicles 
5. Planning and Monitoring  

We recognise that there are many effective measures which The Council cannot achieve alone. We will continue to work with external organisations including businesses, residents and central government on policies and issues beyond Southampton City Council's direct influence.  The key measures in the plan include: 
- Wood burning public engagement programme
- Air quality school's engagement programme
- New high-tech air quality monitors
- Shore-side power for cruise ships docking at the Port of Southampton
- Enhanced air quality requirements in the planning process
- Electric taxi and light commercial vehicle try before you buy scheme including new chargers across the city
- Identify further opportunities for better pedestrian infrastructure including Active Travel Zones 
- Supporting shared  `micromobility' by providing rental manual bike, e-bikes and cargo bikes for residents

`` Of a group of 282 residents surveyed, 88\% consider poor air quality to be a fairly big or very big problem.''

Public Health England estimates that 6.3\% of deaths in Southampton can be attributed to particulate matter pollution - higher than the Southeast England figure of 6.0\%. Research by the Clean Air Fund indicated that if air pollution was cut by a fifth in the city, every year we could see:
- 150 fewer children suffering with reduced lung function
- 81 fewer children suffering with a chest infection and 69 fewer asthmatic children suffering with bronchitic symptoms (cough and phlegm);
- A decrease in the risk of coronary heart disease by around 4.2\% which would result in 48 fewer cases a year; and
- A decrease in lung cancer cases by around 5.9\%, which would result in 10 fewer cases every year.},

Key principles to increase civic participation:
- strength-based - recognising the strengths, value and contributions that exist within all communities and, in particular, the benefits of lived experience informing local decision-making
- collaborative - with underrepresented groups to shape and deliver plans and activity
- honest and open - meaningful relationships and clear leadership
- adaptable - appropriate, accessible and comfortable opportunities for residents to participate that overcome existing obstacles
- proactive and responsive - engaging individuals on their own terms and establishing proactive ways to attract participants},

specifically evolution of science, technology and innovation (STI) policy capacities of three Asian Tigers: Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore

crucial elements of policy capacity are: a) organizational routines, b) search and selection processes and the endogenous and exogenous sources of novelty creation, and c) selection and feedback environments.

policy capacity, defined as the 'set of skills and resources - or competencies and capabilities - necessary to perform policy functions' (Wu et al., 2015, p. 166),

innovation as a phenomenon is quite difficult to theorize, model and measure because it is influenced by both exogenous and endogenous variables and as `endogenous change originates, in the last resort, from the capacity of the system under investigation to produce novelty'

policy-related skills and competences (political, analytical, operational)

Most discussion of capacity considers it there or not there

But innovation is uncertain both in process and outcome

Couldn't be sure that politicians would design it for the people so kept them out of the decision

Learning phase with 160 members. They all went back to their communities for Public Hearing Phase and then Deliberation Phase.

Assembly members found it difficult to advocate for an electoral system that would help to increase women's representation or Aboriginal representation. First, the demographics of these groups in the Assembly did not lend themselves to the formation of a caucus. On one hand, women composed half the Assembly members; on the other hand, there were only two Aboriginal members and a handful of non-Aboriginal members who were interested in the issue of Aboriginal representation. There were too many women to organize a caucus and too few proponents of Aboriginal representation to feel comfortable caucusing. Second, there was little agreement on what constituted a common identity or set of interests for these groups.

Advocates of citizen deliberation methods argue they are superior to traditional means of citizen consultation for a number of reasons. On complex policy issues, citizens have the chance to become informed not only about the issues but also about their fellow citizens' preferences.37 Democratic deliberation produces fairer and potentially more moderate outcomes because it insists on justifying decisions through reasons that are acceptable to all those who will be bound.38 Involving ordinary citizens in deliberative decision making is key to producing potentially more effective decisions, because they bring in their own local knowledge of the problem at hand.39 As described above, the experience of the British Columbia Citizens' Assembly largely bears out these theoretical arguments in favor of citizen-led deliberation and decision making.},

Scharpf and Schmidt distinguished intput, throughput and output legitimacy

input legitimacy - preferences experessed by citizens, e.g. by voting
throughput legitimacy - quality of the governance process
output legitimacy - how well the outcomes match what the people want

``There are two ways in which fair treatment seems to be linked to legitimacy: fairness of processes (procedural fairness) and fairness of outcomes (distributive fairness) (Van den Bos et al. 1997)''

``A fair process is comprised of several specific procedures: providing opportunity to voice people's opinions (voice/public deliberation/participation)...the role of deliberation processes has been emphasized in political science discussions of democracy and communication science discussions of information processing by citizens''

``Deliberation ... involves citizens in a discussion and provides them with an opportunity to voice their opinions and inquire about the issues that are decided on by the authorities. Such deliberative practices are part of procedural fairness and overlap with the throughput dimension of legitimacy (governing with the people)''

``How the policy is made thus influences the shape of the policy ... but also the perception of its fairness''

``the evaluation of the policy, is affected by the level of legitimacy (normative approval)''

``policy studies would benefit from research on procedural fairness (input and throughput legitimacy) and how it relates to distributive fairness (output legitimacy)''

What I take from this is that how a policy is arrived at affects its legitimacy and fairness of process and distribution are important aspect of this legitimacy},

`Well-designed infrastructure is an essential driver of national prosperity and is a pre requisite for economic expansion and for future growth to occur. Infrastructure enables a nation's productivity, quality of life, and economic progression by driving growth, creating jobs, and improving productivity, quality of life and efficiency. It underpins growth by providing the supporting networks upon which we all rely''

``Digital infrastructure increasingly serves as the backbone of prosperous economies, facilitates the global flow of goods and services, and plays an integral part in accelerating economic growth. Additionally, economic security is dependent on a reliably functioning digital infrastructure. Cyber infrastructure serves many purposes, including facilitating the free flow of information, goods, and services; protecting the security and privacy of data; and maintaining the integrity of the interconnected networks.''

focuses on what social and cultural research grounded in fields such as science and technology studies (STS) and internet studies might contribute

Creates loads of different figures to understand data portals

``As well as facilitating the empirical respecification of data portals as sites of material participation (Marres, Reference Marres2012), critical engagements with data portal interfaces, metadata, and software may also inform the rethinking and recomposition of these infrastructures, as well as the relations and forms of life that they sustain'' - so data portals are infrastructures?

about Data.gov.uk:
- Tim Berners-Lee: ``... delivering public services, help communities and society work better ... create new businesses and services''
- Stephen Timms, the minister for Digital Britain: ``a cornerstone of how to strengthen the role of citizens and government'' and ``transformation in the availability of information to the public''
- Gordon Brown: ``using technology and information to provide greater transparency on the workings of Whitehall and give everyone more say over the services they receive''

but often a lot of disappointment, e.g. postcode data not available

``A recent review of literature on data portals suggests that literature is ``almost universally critical, albeit often also constructive'' and suggests an ``expectations gap'' between different aims and the “limitations, faults and unfulfilled promise of portals'' including shortcomings related to machine-readable data, transparency impacts and broader accessibility (Davies, Reference Davies2021)''

visual/video/text chronology of front page of data.gov.uk has National Information Infrastructure (CabinetOffice2013) for 21 or 24 months out of 137 (147 now, 16\%)

websites can be ``googleized'' with a seach box in the centre

data can be ``topicalized'' or sorted by topic

``These sometimes mimic the interfaces of app stores such as Apple's app store and Google's play store, such Data.gov.uk's ``latest apps'' section, positioning data portals as a kind of digital infrastructure upon which innovators and entrepreneurs make things with data, perhaps in the spirit of Tim O'Reilly's ``government as a platform'' (O'Reilly, Reference O'Reilly2010; Morozov, Reference Morozov2013)''

Talks about infrastructure a lot - how standards are embedded and can become invisible until residual categories, edge cases ``the detritus of infrastructure'' become apparent

deconstruct ``infrastructures'' to restore narratives of standards

infrastructures include p13 railroads and urban plumbing, computer language ASCII, environmental policy

What is infrastructure? p17
``boring things'', something that others ``run on'', ``substrate to events and movements'', ``good infrastructure is invisible''
But not everyone is served by a particular infrastructure ``one person's infrastructure is another person's brick wall'' it is relational, only infrastructure in a given cultural context

See also StarR1996 for properties of infrastructure (as listed here on p18). This paper adds one (claiming that it was in the original StarR1996): 
- being fixed in modular increments, not centrally or from overview

infrastructure is strange

``known variables such as gender, race, status, career, power and innovation trajectories are subtly represented in infrastructures'' p18

even discuss maps on p21 identifying how assumptions can be challenged by radically different maps such as explicit mapping of time, emotion and trust

deconstructing infrastructure can reveal a master voice that does not problematize diversity p22 with many embedded assumptions (e.g. skin colour)},

uses the analogy of railway infrastructure to demonstrate how a common framework and a vision of the future can be applied to create a Spatial DAta Infrastructure as part of ``a more coherent national information infrastructure''

In the 1990s discovery metadata services were established and in some cases attempts were made to show the data in a portal (NSDI in the US and the NGDF in the UK -  promoted as ``spatial data infrastructures'' (SDI)

Considers a more tangible analogy:
There are two main parts to an operational rail network: 
1. The rail infrastructure 
2. The rail services that run on the infrastructure

Few standards existed in the early days of railway development and different gauges of track were not uncommon, bridge heights varied and often two railway companies would develop independent routes to the same or similar locations

The challenge for the future of spatial information is therefore to develop a vision for the information infrastructure that does not lead to ``dead ends'' but identifies and supports the kinds of joined-up ``services'' and applications that can be offered

OS MasterMap was launched in late 2001 and the DNF element then took a backseat - but within 2-3 years users were starting to use the methods outlined in the consultation papers.

Gives case studies:
- Atlantis - EA detailed river network developed by OS using DNF model
- Dudley council - property database which cross references base objects in the DNF
- National Access Land - definitive record of public access land after the 2000 countryside and rights of way act
- INSPIRE - interoperable model across EU (2007)

Need for standards and customisable components

paradox of technology - rigid and customizable, product and process, engine and barrier

Ultimately requires standards and calibration and the adapatations to it also require standards and calibration

infrastructure is found to become such by its relationship to organised practices

``universal niche'' - one person's standard is another's chaos

asks ``when is an infrastructure'' p112 - it is not possible to study the thing but the relationships with it p113

properties of infrastructure: p113
- embeddedness - ``sunk'' into other structures, etc
- transparency - does not have to be reinvented each time
- having reach or scope - either spatial or temporal
- being learned as part of membership - needs to be learned about, familiarity is acquired, members take for granted
- links with conventions of practice - shapes and is shaped by conventions
- embodiment of standards - modified by scope of often conflicting conventions
- built on an installed base - from which it inherits strengths and weaknesses
- becoming visible on breakdown

StarL2009 seem to add another property which isn't obvious in this piece:
- being fixed in modular increments, not centrally or from overview

Fantastic typology of issues, also includes how to address these:
- first-order issues - how to gain and maintain access and use:
  - informational issues - finding out about it
  - issues of access - physical, time limitations
  - baseline knowledge and computing expertise
- second-order issues - unforeseen contextual effects
  - technical choices and a classh of cultures - like not liking unix
  - paradoxes of infrastructure - even if first order issues are solved, there can be local reasons for not gaining access
  - tensions between a discipline in flux and contraints as resources
  - ``near-compatibility'' and the ``any day now'' user
- third-order issues - sociology of science
  - triangulation and definition of objects - different disciplines have different ways of defining things
  - multiple meanings, data interpretation and claim staking

  comment          = {The DNF Vision
Most organisations' business information can be associated with a location. The ability to combine or use different information based upon a common location, and to do this reliably and easily, is critical in solving regular business tasks.  The Digital National Framework provides technical methods and guidance to support these operations and is aligned with national strategies and international standards.  By adopting a set of principles and using best practice, such integration is independent of who is responsible for its maintenance and where the work is undertaken, thus achieving the goal of "plug and play"  information, essential in a world of web services.

Ultimately this approach has the potential to evolve into a distributed network of information which, when brought together, can be used with assurance.  Business information can be shared in the knowledge that all users have the confidence that they are referring to the same location and object in the real world.

DNF can be applied to many applications and is also a key requirement of the INSPIRE Directive and the implementation of the UK Location Strategy (UKLS).     

The Digital National Framework is intended to be:
1. Definitive maximising the benefits of definitive referencing

DNF provides a framework using location as the common denominator.  It offers the ability to link information from multiple sources to a definitive location reference through unique identifiers
2. Inclusive reflecting principles of industry best practice

DNF is an open initiative taking input from a variety of interested parties. It encompasses proven and robust international standards. Although developed in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the DNF concept is transferable to other countries.
3. Structured using effective techniques for a “create once, use many times” model

DNF features are referenced through unique identifiers enabling explicit and unambiguous linking and exchange of information. DNF's object-based approach means that data should be collected once, maintained at the most effective level of detail, and then reused in any way the user requires. It offers the ability to create a consistent and structured geographic data model to integrate information easily and reliably.
4. Reliable delivering data integrity for underpinning critical business decisions

DNF uses a consistent form of referencing to provide information integrity, such that information of all kinds can be used to link ifferent views of the world to a common base.   This provides for a high degree of data reliability and accuracy across a multitude of business applications. 
5. Cost-effective lowering the costs of handling multi-source data

The greater the take-up of DNF, the more significant the benefits will be for wider data sharing, thereby leading to lower data handling costs, ease of maintenance and the avoidance of duplicated effort.
6. Flexible enabling information exchange and cross-business applications

The DNF model enables the integration of information from vraried sources,  giving users the ability to share information in cross organisational applications.  It is then easier to associate data from all kinds of sources in a reliable way and to support information transfer in everything from street works and buried services to insurance and civil contingency.   
The Five DNF Principles
Guiding Principles of DNF
Since its inception in 1999 following principles have been adopted:
1. The concept and methods shall be driven by the strategic needs of the wider GI community and the needs of the information industry.

the aim of DNF is to serve the wider community of information users using a common framework and approach.
2. Data should be collected only once and then re-used.

The aim is to avoid unnecessary duplication and confusion and thereby promote faster industry growth
This in turn can enable a new range of applications based on definitive datasets that are proven, reliable, up to date and easy to use
3. Reference information/data should be captured at the highest resolution whenever economically possible.

Information reuse in a wide variety of applications is limited where data has been captured at low resolution
This limits potential data sharing capabilities and downstream value
4. Such information may then, where appropriate, subsequently be used to meet analysis and multi-resolution publishing requirements.

Organisations that capture will invariably wish to publish this at the level of capture and at lower resolutions in one form of aggregated or generalised form
5. DNF will incorporate and adopt existing de facto and de jure standards, wherever they are proven and robust.

In common with the reuse principle any standard e.g., OGC, ISO etc should be adopted where it is shown to add value.
"Hence DNF will foster an environment where users should not need to capture information that already exists. In future information can be reused and added together to form new datasets building on existing proven components."

INSPIRE is a Directive proposed by the European Commission in July 2004 setting the legal framework for the establishment of the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community, for the purposes of Community environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment

INSPIRE will be based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States},

UK's obligations under the European INSPIRE directive

Clearly location data are very important but not being used as much as they could

Contains reference to the 1999 report that said economic contribution of OS is more than £100bn a year

Strategic actions:
- know what data we have and avoid duplication
- use common reference data so we know we're talking about the same places
- share location-related information easily through common infrastructure of standards, technology and business relationships
- have the appropriate skills 
- have strong leadership and governance

common reference example is the use of DNF by NUAG (national undergroup asset group)

1. There is a wide adoption of FAIR principles to UK geospatial data and overall it is adequate for its current use
2. There remain wider and systemic challenges to improving UK geospatial data, particularly as its volume and demand increases

organisation-centric approach to geospatial data improvement in accordance with individual organisational priorities, where cultures, capabilities and appetites for data improvement can diverge

the UK's service sector relies heavily on geospatial data for logistics, financial services, deliveries and marketing. Similarly, the public sector requires geospatial data for the provision of critical and citizen services such as planning, emergency response and border security

They are not self-creating, self-regulating, self-stabilising, or self-legitimising (Rodrik, 2007). This requires incentive structures, enforcement mechanisms, institutions (formal and informal), and the state

Developed from (North, 2005, p. 169): adaptive efficiency is redefined as an ongoing condition of innovation and modification in which the market, through the allocative, discovery and creative functions, responds to the incentive structures that confront choice-makers, utilises localised information, and exploits the creative potential of man to provide solutions to problems and novel situations as they arise.

Definitely needs re-reading in relation to organisations and institutions and how people work together to create good outcomes (deliberation as a market?) 

develops a new perspective linking the concept of “adaptive efficiency” with the allocative, discovery and creative functions of the market from an institutional perspective

referenced in MazzucatoCMKA2020

Understanding the functions of the market in the context of the dynamics of institutional change first requires a perspective that recognises the cumulative and persistent effects of history on the present, as well as the indeterminacy and unknowability of a future that “is in construction, a construction that is going on in all existing activities” (Prigogine, 1985, p. 117)

incorporates the concept of uncertainty introduced by Frank Knight and recognises the deficiency of the assumptions of the neoclassical model when applied to a complex and uncertain reality (Knight, 1921)

also identify the mechanisms that efficiently communicate knowledge among individuals who possess incomplete and imperfect information (Hayek, 1945) and motivate the creative, innovative, and imaginative capacity of individuals

coordinating dispersed knowledge is a central organisation problem (Hayek)

theory of dynamic change is necessary

freedom to fail is vital

willingness in society to undertake risk

adaptive behaviour, evolution towards Nash equilibria not necessarily a predetermined goal

institutional change is incremental and path dependent

discussion of morality - ideally entrepreneurs will have propriety but if not, property needs to be stabilised, respected and protected (unlike leading up to 2007-8 financial crisis).

Public policy should be driven by adaptive efficiency, not allocative efficiency. Washington Consensus failed because of different societies: institutional structures, cultures, histories},

1. Achieving a degree of reliability and safety of systems

The second is of greater concern and least addressed

Joel Feinberg on moral blame (not identical to accountability but correspondent)
A person is morally blameworthy if a) their actions caused harm or significantly contributed to it and b) their actions were ``faulty''

Faulty can be decisions or intentions:
- Intention to harm
- Recklessness in foreseeing harm but taking no action
- Negligence in considering probable harmful consequences

Four barriers to accountability 
1. The problem of many hands
2. The problem of bugs
3. Blaming the computer
4. Software ownership without liability

Many hands example is Therac-25 radiation treatment machine that massively overdosed patients

Attitude that bugs are inevitable reduces accountability},

Simplicity - does it do one thing and do it well?
Clear scope - it should be clear where something fits in the overall `civic stack' and if it is designed for use by a single public institution, or by wider society.
Ongoing development - does it have a team and funding in place to continuously improve it?
Ease of use - can it be used `as is' or does it require customisation? Does it have well designed documentation and open-source code libraries (in addition to the core piece of software)?
Solves a common need - is it meeting a genuine need for multiple use cases, and is there evidence for it?
Governance model - does it have a decision-making process that represents the interests of all users not just a single organisation?},

I argue that the community that is building around digital public goods should actually double down on the focus on infrastructure, even if it means less software carrying the label of `digital public goods'. Digital public goods should become synonymous with infrastructure.},

Three observations from history:
1. democracy is not just government by, of and for the people, it is also devices and institutions
2 .democracy depends on its surrounding ecosystem that shapes options and how wisely they are considered
3. reform happens in stages with cultures and requirements

1. reform parliament to make use of free intelligence:
- Examples of democratic deliberation from Taiwan, also Select Committees
- Improve quality of debates with live fact checking
- Citizens to appear in the chamber
- Parliamentary refurbishment is an opportunity to experiment with different options

2. Deliberation on the big issues
-  that the main parties struggle with - suggests a hybrid of citizens assemblies and expert commissions ``open commissions'':
  1. start with diagnosis
  2. explore options
  3. make recommendations

3. Knowledge commons to fuel democracy
- stronger legal requirements on major media to support truth
- centres for ``what works''
- committee for the future
- strengthen arms length institutions like IPCC IPBES

Ultra-local democracy

Referendums must have preceding phase of deliberation and 60\% confirmatory requirement

There the despotic leviathan reigns is the surveillance state, where the leviathan is absent is the reight of the private sector silos. Where the power of state and private sector is weak is the failure to launch. Where both state and private sector are strong we have democratic governance. Then asks what does this last quadrant look like and how can digital capabilities help to serve it?

- the entrepreneurial state - recognises importance of state to de-risk, risk aversion of private sector

- Backing businesses to go green (3 actions)
- Catalysing local action (3 actions)
- Increasing transparency and engaging people (4 actions)
- Delivering cleaner, cheaper and greener homes (2 actions)
- Capitalising on the UK's international leadership (2 actions)
- Setting the UK up for 2050 and beyond (2 actions)

Main message from consultations is there is huge problem with long term uncertainty lack of long term confidence/funding/etc

Overview and reactions available at \url{https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/mission-zero-independent-review-of-net-zero/}

``the Review has heard from many respondents frustrated by a lack of long-term thinking, siloed behaviour from government departments, and uncertainty over the length of funding commitments''

``The government, working with sectoral leads by Autumn 2023, must apply whole systems thinking to create an R\&D and technology roadmap outlining the key decision points that must be made to ensure priority technologies deliver on the UK's net zero and growth ambitions''

3rd key recommendation: ``Make regulatory processes more agile to match that of innovation by a) establishing up to three new R\&D demonstrator projects, out to 2035, aligning with the ten-year missions set out by this review, and b) including in forthcoming work from the Office for Science and Technology Strategy (OSTS) how regulators can provide more opportunity for demonstrations for net zero technologies'' - see reference to Vallance in \url{https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-11-17/debates/97DB3122-0068-46CD-B026-F757C8DF39AF/AutumnStatement}

Metrics: recommend reporting GHG like GDP and reporting climate impacts of future spending reviews

Lots on R\&D - especially section 6.2 Getting R\&D and technology for net zero ready for the future including the technology readiness level TRLs for carbon reduction and low carbon technologies

Finds that current plans are very varied and it's difficult to detect greenwash as few standard metrics

Recommends standards for transition plans and independent auditing. Also, sector-specific pathways and public indicators to indicate progress to directors, staff, customers and industry how each business compares to others in the same sector

Also lots on investment and sustainable bond markets

Current ISO standards do not quite cover this but there are aspects in several existing standards. Suggest that a new transition plan standard is required

Many companies with plans are reporting the rest things they have done but less of what they plan to do. 

There are a range of approaches in the literature that are considered. Suggest that these are based around for competing design concepts

Use sustainability framework of WiekWR2011 which has 5 key competencies:
- Systems Thinking
- Anticipatory (Futures Thinking)
- Normative (Values Thinking)
- Strategic (Action-Oriented)
- Interpersonal (Collaboration)

More environmentally effective actions are taken by leaders in politics, economics and civil society but the overall responsibility to solve complex problems—such as the global climate crisis, loss of biodiversity, and pollution—is focused on individuals instead of on the big players - this is not sufficient

``The fact that 70\% of the emissions come from fossil fuel producers makes sustainable transformation predominantly a political task''

Suggests that developing educational programmes can help bridge the distance between the private and public sphere and this research aims to identify what skills sustainbility-aware and effective decision-makers use (so that these may be incorporated into training programmes).

interviewed 14 actual decision makers from politics, the economy, and civil society with a strong commitment to environmental and social ethics and who are contributing to global sustainable development

``The interview recordings were transcribed manually according to the Dresing and Pehl convention [35], and analyzed within the qualitative content analysis framework suggested by Kuckartz [36]. MAXQDA, a software developed to support text analysis digitally, has been applied to assist the inductive and deductive coding, note-taking, summarizing, and categorizing of research data. We analyzed the interview data with theory-based competency models. In this article, we applied Wiek et al.'s [7] framework of key competencies in sustainability''

Competencies:
- (systems) considering inter- and trans-disciplinarity; identifying the core behind a sustainable-related problem; and taking a broader perspective between (sub)systems, disciplines, and regions.
- (anticipatory): understanding intrinsic times of different systems and different scenarios with their effects, dealing with increasing uncertainty, and accepting finiteness
- (normative): committing to grown values as an orientation framework, seeing challenges as opportunities, and building resilience when dealing with negative facts
- (strategic): understanding the complex dynamics of democratic decision making, developing transformative strategies towards sustainability, and seeing challenges as opportunities
- (interpersonal): collaboration with different stakeholders in highly conflicted and controversial settings, working in interdisciplinary teams, and designing transformative communication strategies

Themes:
- Sustainable Decision Making Means Translating between Heterogeneous Disciplines, Communities, and Stakeholders - systems and interpersonal are dominant because part of a system and need to communicate decisions
- Extrapolating Knowledge among Systems, Time Scales, and Ontological Levels - entire system not details, multiple time scales in sustainable development and climate change that can lead to overestimation and underestimation, and further on to misleading solutions in communication
- Dealing with Uncertainty - increasing change, fundamental uncertainties grow, trust becomes more important, not guided by strong emotions, making the necessary possible
- Building Resilience - professional, optimistic

Aspects of sustainability competencies which are particularly important for decision makers:
- Systemic Interdisciplinary Thinking
  - Private- vs. Public-Sphere Decisions
  - Taking a Macroscopic Standpoint
  - Understanding the System Effect behind Many Individual Systems
- Building Resilience
- Following Own Values
- Teamwork and Diverse Stakeholder Management

Interesting summary work showing how tools for automatic curation and filtering of data can have negative outcomes for marginalized populations: ``In one case, the use of a block list to remove “pornographic” text was shown to also suppress LGBTQ+ and African American English (AAE) text from a corpus (Dodge et al., 2021). In another, using Reddit outgoing links as an indicator of quality for a seed corpus (Radford et al., 2019) leads to trained models that implicitly prioritize US-centric views in their outputs (Johnson et al., 2022). In yet another project, a filtering approach that relied on a machine learning image-text alignment model was shown to exacerbate its biases in the created multimodal dataset (Birhane et al., 2021).''

They therefore ``prioritize human involvement, local expertise, and language expertise in our data curation and documentation process''

Details how the data were curated, the model architecture, how the model was trained, the engineering infrastructure used, even calculations of the carbon footprint

``BLOOM training add up to approximately 81 tons of CO2eq'' (about 10 homes energy use per year according to \url{https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator})

 evaluations focus on zero-shot and few-shot settings:
- SuperGLUE (classification tasks)
- machine translation
- summarization
- code generation
- HELM 5-shot benchmark - which has some nice comparisons for accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias and toxicity

Signalling Outcomes by 2030 (my wording):
- clear credible consistent communication on priorities and actions (increase stakeholder confidence)
- co-create and build shared science and technology goals (increase knowledge of the value of science and technology)
- promote UK science and technology internationally (maintain international position)

Investment outcomes by 2030:
- increase private sector investment in r\&d
- ensure diversity in science and technology
- raise public investment in r\&d
- accelerate translation, commercialisation and knowledge exchange
- reduce bureaucracy of research and innovation funding

Also sets out outcomes for:
- Talent and skills
- financing companies
- procurement
- international opportunities
- access to infrastructure
- regulation and standards
- innovative public sector

Considers that leadership has three sacred aspects:
- the separation between leaders and followers
- the sacrifice of leaders and followers
- the way leaders silence the anxiety and resistance of followers

Where we are trying to move away from the heroic leader we instead have distributed leadership, where everyone is a leader

  abstract         = {The topic of technology development and its disruptive effects has been the subject of much debate over the last 20 years with numerous theories at both macro and micro scales offering potential models of technology progression and disruption. This paper focuses on how theories of technology progression may be integrated and considers whether suitable indicators of this progression and any subsequent disruptive effects might be derived, based on the use of big data analytic techniques. Given the magnitude of the economic, social, and political implications of many disruptive technologies, the ability to quantify disruptive change at the earliest possible stage could deliver major returns by reducing uncertainty, assisting public policy intervention, and managing the technology transition through disruption into deployment. However, determining when this stage has been reached is problematic because small random effects in the timing, direction of development, the availability of essential supportive technologies or &ldquo;platform&rdquo; technologies, market response or government policy can all result in failure of a technology, its form of adoption or optimality of implementation. This paper reviews key models of technology evolution and their disruptive effect including the geographical spread of disruption. The paper then describes a use case and an experiment in disruption prediction, looking at the geographical spread of disruption using internet derived historic data. The experiment, although limited to one specific aspect of the integrated model outlined in the paper, provides an initial example of the type of analysis envisaged. This example offers a glimpse into the potential indicators and how they might be used to measure disruption hinting at what might be possible using big data approaches.},

This paper prototypes potential objective measures to assess technology progression using internet-based data. These measures may help reduce the subjective nature of such assessments and, in conjunction with other techniques, reduce the uncertainty of technology progression assessment. The paper examines one part of the technology ecosystem, namely, academic research and publications. It uses analytics performed against a large body of academic paper abstracts and metadata published over 20 years to propose and demonstrate candidate indicators of technology progression. Measures prototyped are: (i) overall occurrence of technologies used over time in research, (ii) the fields in which this use was made; (iii) the geographic spread of specific technologies within research and (iv) the clustering of technology research over time. An outcome of the analysis is an ability to assess the measures of technology progression against a set of inputs and a set of commentaries and forecasts made publicly in the subject area over the last 20 years. The potential automated indicators of research are discussed together with other indicators which might help working groups in assessing technology progression using more quantitative methods.},

Interesting references to Mazzucato:

``Mazzucato (2011) [6] suggests that many commercial products (such as the Apple iPhone), only exist because of numerous government research outputs which were then exploited by Apple (see Brackin et al. (2019) [16]). The implication of technology (the precursor to products) being created in commercial organizations is that it is less visible. The experimentation described in this paper highlights issues around this.''

``Mazzucuto's [sic] work in papers relating to state funding of research, again cannot be fully proven by this work but the indicators show that many technologies identified by consultants or the press did occur previously in research. A good example of this is Internet of Things''.

My questions about this work concern that reliability of any developed measure if it were to become known - e.g. could it be gamed? Also, more immediately, some researchers are more prolific in terms of publications than others, it doesn't always reflect the volume of research that they do. Is this a problem with the method?},

  abstract         = {Extreme urban heat is a powerful environmental stressor which poses a significant threat to human health and well-being. Exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, heat events are expected to become more intense and frequent as climate change progresses, though we have limited understanding of the impact of such events on vulnerable populations at a neighborhood or census block group level. Focusing on the City of Portland, Oregon, this study aimed to determine which socio-demographic populations experience disproportionate exposure to extreme heat, as well as the level of access to refuge in the form of public cooling centers or residential central air conditioning. During a 2014 heat wave, temperature data were recorded using a vehicle-traverse collection method, then extrapolated to determine average temperature at the census block group level. Socio-demographic factors including income, race, education, age, and English speaking ability were tested using statistical assessments to identify significant relationships with heat exposure and access to refuge from extreme heat. Results indicate that groups with limited adaptive capacity, including those in poverty and non-white populations, are at higher risk for heat exposure, suggesting an emerging concern of environmental justice as it relates to climate change. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of cultural sensitivity and inclusion, in combination with effectively distributing cooling centers in areas where the greatest burden befalls vulnerable populations.},

Lacking, however, are insights into fundamental questions about the role of historical housing policies in cauterizing current exposure to climate inequities like intra-urban heat. Here, we explore the relationship between &ldquo;redlining&rdquo;, or the historical practice of refusing home loans or insurance to whole neighborhoods based on a racially motivated perception of safety for investment, with present-day summertime intra-urban land surface temperature anomalies. Through a spatial analysis of 108 urban areas in the United States, we ask two questions: (1) how do historically redlined neighborhoods relate to current patterns of intra-urban heat? and (2) do these patterns vary by US Census Bureau region? Our results reveal that 94\% of studied areas display consistent city-scale patterns of elevated land surface temperatures in formerly redlined areas relative to their non-redlined neighbors by as much as 7 &deg;C. Regionally, Southeast and Western cities display the greatest differences while Midwest cities display the least. Nationally, land surface temperatures in redlined areas are approximately 2.6 &deg;C warmer than in non-redlined areas. While these trends are partly attributable to the relative preponderance of impervious land cover to tree canopy in these areas, which we also examine, other factors may also be driving these differences. This study reveals that historical housing policies may, in fact, be directly responsible for disproportionate exposure to current heat events.},

The Idealist School--Ideas Rule the World
- trace to ancient philosophers
- collective ideas ``have an intersubjective existence that stands above individual minds and is typically embodied in symbols, discourse, and institutions'' (Legro)
- Weber argues that a particular form of capitalism arose from protestantism
- Geels interpretivism/constructivism
- cultural values, dominant paradigms and world views shaping human actions at different levels--ranging from local social practices, societies as a whole, the economic system or even international governance at a global level

The Institutional School--Institutions are Enablers of Societal Change
- trace to age of enlightenment
- institutions are broadly ``webs of interrelated rules and norms that govern social relationships, comprise the formal and informal social constraints that shape the choice-set of actors'' (Nee)
- their longevity creates stability, reducing uncertainty
- the regime in the multi-level perspective (Geels)
- both constraining and enabling of human action

The Technological Innovation School--Technological Progress Drives Modern Societies
- trace to 20th century, industrialisation
- Kondratieff's (1926) long-waves of development, Schumpeter's (1939) creative destruction
- innovation in technologies and infrastructures increasingly become recognized as the central driver of societal change

Describes the origins and arguments and outlines how it could not only lead to the death of millions but how it might be self-defeating

yet, these ideas have been discussed in governments

``a small group of theorists mostly based in Oxford have been busy working out the details of a new moral worldview called longtermism, which emphasizes how our actions affect the very long-term future of the universe - thousands, millions, billions, and even trillions of years from now. This has roots in the work of Nick Bostrom, who founded the grandiosely named Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) in 2005, and Nick Beckstead, a research associate at FHI and a programme officer at Open Philanthropy. It has been defended most publicly by the FHI philosopher Toby Ord, author of The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity (2020). Longtermism is the primary research focus of both the Global Priorities Institute (GPI), an FHI-linked organisation directed by Hilary Greaves, and the Forethought Foundation, run by William MacAskill, who also holds positions at FHI and GPI''

``Washington, DC-based Center for Security and Emerging Technologies (CSET) aims to place longtermists within high-level US government positions to shape national policy. In fact, CSET was established by Jason Matheny, a former research assistant at FHI who's now the deputy assistant to US President Joe Biden for technology and national security. Ord himself has, astonishingly for a philosopher, `advised the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, the US National Intelligence Council, the UK Prime Minister's Office, Cabinet Office, and Government Office for Science', and he recently contributed to a report from the Secretary-General of the United Nations that specifically mentions `long-termism'''

Elon Musk has cited and endorsed Bostrom's work and donated \$1.5 million dollars to FHI},

- Connectors: the few people who seem to easily connect to very many
- Mavens: the people who specialise in information
- Salesmen: the people who persuade

The stickiness factor - something makes the message unforgettable

The power of context - the environment is strongly influential
- studies showing crime/criminality/lying/etc. are more influence by environment that background
- studies showing how the grouping of people impacts social epidemnics e.g. book groups that cause books to become bestsellers

Rule of 150 - that channel capacity of brain for social groups is limited. In this book it suggests that its around 150 people - any individual cannot keep track or more than the relationships that occur within a group of around 150 people [other studies find other numbers I believe]. This organisations that take care to keep groups to this size function well often, e.g. Gore \& Associates who split when their groups exceed 150 people, and who require little hierarchy as a result

The description of this latter example made links for me with Scott2020, in which the creation of "legibility" for governments (and leaders of organisations) can destroy the functionality of the country/city/organisation. - people have intrinsic ways of working out how to function together which may appear chaotic on the outside but work extremely efficiently

The Case study about smoking is interesting as it indicates that teenagers are unaffected by health information and parental smoking habits but are affected by their peer group (the law of the few) and their own genetics (stickiness) . Since its difficult to prevent those from spreading the idea of smoking would not a better approach to stopping smoking addiction be to create non-addictive (i..e. much less potent) cigarettes?

Under sneakers case study goes into depth about innovators - those people who start a trend and are useful for identifying a brand's next move:
``These kids [feel like outcasts]. They always felt like they were different ... what worries them ... germ warfare or terrorism. They pick up on bigger picture things. You see more activists ... people with more passion'' p208

Recent studies are finding they may be so, but its is not their inherent nature but the nature of industrial organisations.

The hierarchy of needs (physioslogical and safety, then social, ego and self-fulfillment). ``A satisfied need is not a motivator of behaviour''

``many studies have demonstrated that the tightly knit, cohesive work group may, under proper conditions, be far more effective than an equal number of separate individual in achieving organisational goals''

Scientific management often works to reduce social connection (my word) and mechanistic production give little heed to egoistic human needs.

passivity, hostility, refusal to accept responsiblity, lack of productivity are symptoms of unmet needs - often higher needs

Good wages, conditions, benefits etc. support physiological and safety needs but other needs must be met

Theory Y about management says that mgt are reponsible for money, materials, people, etc, staff are not passive, resistent by nature. Mgt is responsible for enabling staff to achieve their won goals with their own eforts - creating opportunities.

Applications of theory Y:
- decentralisation and delegation
- job enlargement
- participation and consultative management
- performance appraisal - ``highly tentative'' - setting one's own tragets

  abstract         = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

Doubly punishes marginalised communities - least benefit from LLM most cost from environmental impact

UNFATHOMABLE TRAINING DATA
- Size Doesn't Guarantee Diversity
- Static Data/Changing Social Views
- Encoding Bias
- Curation, Documentation & Accountability - this is needed

DOWN THE GARDEN PATH
time spent on building models with ever larger data sets is ``time not spent applying meaning capturing approaches to meaning sensitive tasks, and on the other hand in terms of time not spent exploring more effective ways of building technology with datasets of a size that can be carefully curated and available for a broader set of language''

Risks and Harms

Data on which LLMs are trained are likely to more male, young, hegemonic. Simple approaches to removing pornography, toxic data, etc may also remove the words of people in marginalised groups.

``LMs absorbing the hegemonic worldview from their training data. When humans produce language, our utterances reflect our worldviews, including our biases. As people in positions of privilege with respect to a society's racism, misogyny, ableism, etc., tend to be overrepresented in training data for LMs, this training data thus includes encoded biases, many already recognized as harmful''

Risk mitigation

Urge researchers to shift to a mindset of careful planning, along many dimensions, before starting to build either datasets or systems trained on datasets.

Start from identifying research time as valuable - what is the best way to use our time and support others to build on this work. Set a (time, storage) budget in advance and work to it (e.g. stop building the dataset when you no longer have budget to document it). Documentating procesess, data, motivation etc. Adopt approaches from value-senstive design.},

2. rapidly affect all life on Earth

OpenAI, DeepMind and others try to mitigate existential risk via an area of research known as AI alignment. Alignment is unsolved - we don't understand huamn brain, so emergent AI brains would be ``monumental''. Also number of ppl working in AI alignment is tiny

``The majority of resources were going towards making AI more capable, not safer''

``As an investor, I have found it challenging to persuade other investors to fund alignment. Venture capital currently rewards racing to develop capabilities more than it does investigating how these systems work''

Very much about reducing red tape, I think less about increasing incentives to do the right thing...?

Recommendations:
- Sandboxing - Recommendation 1: Government should work with regulators to develop a multiregulator sandbox for AI to be in operation within the next six months
- Generative AI - Recommendation 2: Government should announce a clear policy position on the relationship between intellectual property law and generative AI to provide confidence to innovators and investors.
- Data - Recommendation 3: Facilitate greater industry access to public data, and prioritise wider data sharing and linkage across the public sector, to help deliver the
government's public services transformation programme.
- Transport - Recommendation 4: The government should bring forward the Future of Transport Bill to unlock innovation across automated transport applications.

Drones - work with and empower CAA, amend regulation of raio communications
Data - update guidance on who is controller etc with AI services
Space and satellite technologies - reduce regulatory constraints
Cyber Security - stronger legal protections for cyber security reseearchers
Looking ahead to newly emerging technologies - ``One message that comes across clearly from industry is that the government should avoid regulating emerging digital technologies too early, to avoid the risk of stifling innovation. We therefore recommend that the government and regulators should continue to engage with industry on issues around safety, risk and benefits of innovation, and that the government and regulators should rapidly build capability and know-how to enable them to positively shape regulatory frameworks at the right time.

Some useful points considering business decision making in the future

``the “forecasting business” is - at best - an imperfect endeavor. This task may, however, never have been as daunting as today, in this age of multiple disruptions: social, economic, spiritual, and technological''

`an examination of the field of business ethics seems to point to the fact that at its different stages in its existence it has been coopted in the service of aims other than simply to promote ethical behavior ...
- ... help establish and secure the status of business as a “real” profession [in early days] ...
- ...  a means to impede the spread of communism by showing that market economies work best [in Cold War] ...
- ... to (re)establish the legitimacy of business and stem the tide of waning public trust in business [recently, e.g. CSR] ...
- the business citizen exhibits good citizenship simply by creating wealth [now, still CSR]''

``result of the increased interest in CSR is the displacement of focus away from the individual decision maker and their personality, proclivities and problems''

Summary of Millennials in relation to decision-making as they are likely to be future business leaders. One of many interesting characteristics of Millennials is ``hyper-mobility'' - they expect to change jobs a great deal. [Iz: This is an aspect of increasing business volatility and a reason for strong knowledge management]

``the argument “ethics for ethics' sake” may - actually - resonate particularly well with members of the Millennial generation destined to be those making business decisions in coming decades'' 

``we are likely facing a situation in which the fluidity of change in the business world will severely limit the ability of law and perhaps even societal mechanisms dictating norms to keep pace with that change and the associated business dilemmas that may emerge''},

This paper performs a series of experiements on cohorts of adults to determine how much this correlates with unethical decisions

``we hypothesized that individuals high in future self-continuity would better recognize the future consequences of decisions made in the present''
``possibility that consideration of future consequences mediates the relationship between future self-continuity and disapproval of unethical negotiation strategies''

``a robust significant relationship between low future self-continuity and unethical choices, even when controlling for a host of potentially relevant personality variables''

A further experiment found that people tasked with considering how similar a person is to their future self were less likely to advocate inappropriate negotiation strategies

the future self-continuity manipulation only affected judgments of unethical behaviors and not all judgments [or at least it didn't affect competitive bargaining, strategic misrepresentation of positive emotion, and strategic misrepresentation of negative emotion]

Suggest research is needed to understand if lack of empathic understanding, or power, may be what leads to low future self continuity and also whether how an individual's the future self continuity varies with the timescales over which they are reporting ([e.g. 1, 5, 10 years]) relates to ethical decision making.},

  abstract         = {The operating model of the global oil industry is not compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement. For the industry, there is a fundamental tension between two competing mandates: the pressure to contribute to the social goal of climate change mitigation, and the need to perform financially and meet obligations to shareholders in activities that directly contribute to climate change. To explore the range of responses to the tension, we interview professionals from large international oil companies who work or have worked in climate related roles. This is novel data from a professional group that has not previously been interviewed in depth about climate change. We develop a framework of six archetypical responses to tension within the oil industry. Examples of strategic responses include accepting the paradox to choose priorities other than climate change mitigation and confronting the paradox to demand changes to the way the oil industry operates. Examples of defensive responses include the transfer of responsibility and projection of tension to other stakeholders. Responses calling for change in the oil industry are the most common among people who have left the industry and the least common for participants from companies headquartered outside of Europe. In a field marked by controversies and value-based debates, a better understanding of the views of people working on the energy transition inside the oil industry provides new insight into the discussion about possible routes to the sustainability transition.},
  comment          = {Useful structure for reporting on outputs of semi-structured interviews

Also useful review of literature of paradox management and sensemenaking in the face of paradox

``A paradox-oriented frame of mind can help managers navigate the complexity and interconnectedness of sustainability concerns in the context of business''

``Sensemaking is widely used as a research framing for studying organisational adaptation and change''

``The research is inductive: themes emerging from the collected data are identified with the aim of mapping them onto a theoretical framework around the concepts of sensemaking and tension''

Responses to identified paradox fall into two groups of archytypes:
Strategic:
- Acceptance - different priorities
- Confrontation - change is needed
- Transcendence - business and climate objectives align
Defensive:
- Transfer of responsibility - it's someone else's job
- Projection of tension - others have it worse
- Questioning realism - change will be slower and harder than you think

Defensive responses are broken down further:
- Transfer: Government; Public; Investors
- Projection: Other oil companies; other industries; public
- Questioning: Pace of change; Energy mix},

1. higher exposure to climate, e.g. due to nature of economy
2. lower capacity to adapt
[no acknowledgement of why this the case!]

``the incidence of natural catastrophes is similar in developed and developing countries, 90 per cent of deaths from these events occur in the developing world''

In a way, nothing Earth-shattering in here, but plenty that is relevant to all economies and probably organisations in a time of greater uncertainty.

Nicholas Stern (2009): adaptation should not be seen as an additional policy agenda to deliver, but as ``development in a harsher climate''

principles relevant to managing uncertainty as well as integrating adaptation within existing priorities:
- Coordination at national level
- Broad-based and participatory planning - cross-sectoral government departments, non-government actors, including civil society groups and highly affected communities, and the private sector
- Programmatic and integrated with existing priorities
- Looking beyond the short term
- Implement a continuous process, not a one-off
- Learning the lessons

`` starting with the adaptation problem itself, rather than the climate models, not only facilitates better integration with existing priorities, but also reduces the data and resources needed for adaptation planning ...  avoids wasting resources on generating information that is not pertinent to making decisions''

Managing uncertainty: focus on principles, not projections:
- Firstly, consider long-term climate risks within existing planning and policymaking processes - avoid lock-in
- Secondly, move faster and harder on core development objectives - no-regrets adaptation
- focus on additional measures that directly reduce vulnerability to current climate-related risks
- with expensive, long-term projects, seek `low-regrets' ways to build in flexibility},

Missing from this model when considering real human beings are:
- the alternatives are often not given, but sought, which is thus part of the process
- the information is seldom given and so searching for consequences is another part of the process
- the comparisons are usually not made in terms of a single criterion, search is therefore often for a satisfactory alternative
- the problem is also often not given, searching for significant problems becomes and important organisational task

  comment          = {Science is about finding invariants. If we have only simple change we can use differential models, 

Human rational behavious is the study of both:
- structure of task environments 
- the computational capabilities of the actor

``any real-world problem, is also beyond exact compution. Therefore, because of the limits on their computing speeds and power, intelligent systems must use approximate methods to handle most tasks. Their rationality is bounded''. Principle of bounded rationality Simon 1989b.

Invariants in cognitive psychology include
-  time to recognise
- number of chunks of info in short term memory (chunks need to be recognisable)

We now know that experts make extensive use of recognition processes, based on stored knowledge, to handle their everyday tasks. This recognition capability, based (by rough estimate) on 50,000 or more stored cues and associated knowledge, allows them to solve many problems ``intuitively'' that is, in a few seconds, and without conscious analysis

satisficing: using experience to construct an expectation of how good a solution we might reasonably achieve, and halting search as soon as a solution is reached that meets the expectation

means-ends analysis: noting differences between the current situation and the desired goal situation, and retrieving from memory operators that, experience has taught us, remove differences of these kinds

Problem solving by recognition. by heuristic search. and by pattern recognition and extrapolation are examples of rational adaptation to complex task environments that take appropriate account of computational limitations-of bounded rationality. They are not optimizing techniques. but methods for arriving at satisfactory solutions with modest amounts of computation

Two tracks going back to Woodworth - problem-solving and reasoning

Many variants are social and therefore only invariant over particular society or social group

People are adaptive

To explain the behavior of a system of bounded rationality we must describe the system's processes and also the environments to which it is adapting

Problem solving by recognition, by heuristic search, and by pattern recognition are adaptive techniques that are compatible with bounded rationality

  - non-optimal decision because not all information used
  - resistance to decision impacts action taking
3. no adaptation in action plans to changing contexts

In an increasingly uncertain and unpredictable world, sense making, decision making, and action taking must become ever more rapidly and repeatedly iterated, deeply embedded, and widely distributed throughout the teams (Marlow2023).

Propose a simple theory that elucidates the frequent failure of AI explanations to engender appropriate reliance and complementary decision making performance. We argue explanations are only useful to the extent that they allow a human decision maker to verify the correctness of an AI's prediction

Finds/suggests that AI explanations:
- are better equipped at facilitating holistic AI processes such as model development and debugging, regulatory audit, and knowledge discovery
- have been used to uncover spurious patterns in learned models [ 15] and enable interactive debugging processes
- offer model interpretability desirable for ensuring compliance with organizational policies, industry standards, and government regulation
- may help decision makers develop new knowledge about a decision making task 

 If an AI model significantly outperforms human decision makers, and its explanations can effectively convey learned signals or patterns in the task features, then humans may be able to replicate such behavior to improve their own decision making on future instances

``For decision making, the existing literature largely studies the influence of local explanations, which provide information about individual AI recommendations. These include visualizations of model uncertainty, feature importance, rule-based explanations, example-based explanations, counterfactual explanations, or natural language rationale explanations. In contrast, global explanations aim to provide holistic insight into the entirety of an AI model, for instance by visualizing or otherwise detailing a model's complete architecture. Faithfulness is another dimension used to characterize explanations. A faithful explanation is one that accurately represents the reasoning process behind a model's prediction. Some intrinsically interpretable models, such as GA2Ms [ 15 ], are favored because it is (relatively) easy for a human to understand the model's behavior. Other explanations are generated by post-hoc analysis, e.g. using techniques such as LIME [ 57 ] or SHAP [45 ]. While these methods produce local explanations for otherwise inscrutable models, they are by definition approximations or a model's true reasoning process, and hence raise concerns of faithfulness.''


Alternative paradigms:
- Cognitive Forcing Strategies - AI to encourage greater engagement of decision-maker
- Interactive XAI - improve human understanding of teh AI model
- Evaluative XAI - present evidence to support or refute any set of decisions
- Human-AI Delegation - e.g. AI triages decisions so humans and AI collaborate},

Sensemaking is about the interplay of action and interpretation rather than the influence of evaluation on choice ``good people struggling to make sense'' rather than as ``bad ones making poor decisions''

``The operative image of organization is one in which organization emerges through sensemaking, not one in which organization precedes sensemaking or one in which sensemaking is produced by organization''

Uses a paedeatric nursing case to illustrating what sensemaking is

Sensemaking Is About Labeling

Categories have plasticity because they:
- are socially defined
- have to be adapted to local circumstances
- have a radial structure - a few central instances but most are peripheral instances that have only a few of these features

peripheral cases that are more equivocal in meaning, their action is more variable, more indeterminate, more likely to alter organizing, and more consequential for adapting

Sensemaking Is Retrospective - e.g. can only be mistaken after it has gone wrong (paradox)

Sensemaking Is About Presumption - presumption triggers action which then informs sensemaking

Sensemaking Is Social and Systemic

Sensemaking Is About Action
- ``what's going on here?'' [used a lot in KeyK2020]
- ``what do I do next?''

Sensemaking Is About Organizing Through Communication - To share understanding means to lift equivocal knowledge out of the tacit, private, complex, random, and past to make it explicit, public, simpler, ordered, and relevant to the situation at hand (Obstfeld, 2004)

Section on Campbell's application of evolutionary epistemology to social life, which I can't really follow but includes a model of actors interacting with their environment, selecting those exchanges that are meaningful and preseving those that are plausible [I think]. 

the concept of enacted environments suggests that constraints are partly of one's own making and not simply objects to which one reacts

Meanings derived from sensemaking are redrafted continuously. Plausibility is a fundamental criterion of sensemaking and is less about accuracy that fitting with [beliefs and needs] of the sensemaker(s). Evidence that managers' perceptions are highly inaccurate but ``Managerial misperceptions may not curtail effective performance if agents have learning mechanisms and operate in a context where there are incentives to improve performance''

There is also sensegiving - providing meaning to an audience which can also affect the sensemaker

Sensemaking in organisations - should it be distributed to create a collective sense?

Sensemaking and power - to shape hearts and minds is to influence at least seven dimensions of sensemaking:
- social relations that are encouraged and discouraged
- identities that are valued or derogated
- retrospective meanings that are accepted or discredited
- cues that are highlighted or suppressed
- updating that is encouraged or discouraged
- standard of accuracy or plausibility to which conjectures are held
- approval of proactive or reactive action as the preferred mode of coping

Sensemaking also should have an emotional component - discussion of this},

The management of multiple overlapping crises creates specific challenges for maintaining democratic resilience

Regular crises are now likely to be a continuing feature, rather than a transitory phenomenon

When shocks occur, they are more likely than before to have cascading and unexpected consequences

Governments also face constraints on their ability to address future shocks, due to the accrued effects (“scarring”) from past crises

Risks to democratic resilience are real: globally, the extent and quality of democracy has fallen over the past decade or more

To safeguard democratic resilience in the multi-crises environment, governments must take decisive steps to support trust in public institutions over the long-term

Better institutionalising participatory processes in policy and decision making would improve the involvement of citizens

Strategic foresight will be increasingly indispensable for managing the long term

Governments should take steps to maximise the agility of their workforces},

``Those who are arguing that 1.5°C is lost - as well as those still defending its
prospects - are seeking to influence what societies do in response to the deepening climate and ecological crisis''

Arguments that 1.5 is still alive can slow the pace of change and emphasise only incremental action (``stay on course'') or even create some of the ``discourses in climate delay''. Alternatively, arguments that 1.5 is lost may attempt to be a ``wake-up call' to shock society into transformative change, although this risks possibly also creating an appetite for technological solutions (which slows actions) or perhaps just kills action, because the barriers are insurmountable. The many narratives all have agendas and risks. ``In reality, transformational change is not being achieved and so the chance that the 1.5°C goal will be missed is growing''.

Definitions of extreme contexts - different from crisis
crisis is [probably] episodic, low probability, occur suddenly and threaten high priority goals
extreme context is when this reaches intolerable magnitude, goals become imperative, yet there may be foresight or even control over initiation of exrteme event, they may even have high probability (examples are firefighers on call, emergency rooms, fighting in war)

Extreme contexts comprise:
- Location in time
- Magnitude of consequences
- Probability of consequences
- Physical or psycho-social proximity
- Form of threat
Which all affect the level of extremity and in turn the adaptive leadership response. This response affects attenuators:
- Psych resources
- Social resources
- Organisational resources 
and intensifiers:
- Time
- Complexity
and attenuators and intensifiers themselves feed into the level of extremity

Lots of detail on all the above
Typology of organisations that operate in extreme contexts:
- Trauma (ambulance, A\&E, ...)
- Critical action (military, disaster response, ...)
- High reliability (police, fire, ...)
- Naive (hotel in a terrorist attack, ...)

Reviews of work that covers parts of this sequence is well worth returning to, including tables summarising relevants papers in each topic. 

On organisational learning:
``Clarke and Perrow (1996) attribute learning failures to the symbolic nature of organizational plans, which are often unrealistically optimistic, particularly in high-technology, high-risk contexts. Carroll (1998, p. 715) notes the preference for simple and rapid solutions that do not address complex interdependent problems''

``Organizational learning is a political process shaped by the interpretations and interests of competing stakeholders (Coopey and Burgoyne 2000;Lawrenceet al. 2005). Stakeholders protect themselves from scapegoating by producing their own event narratives (Smith and Elliott 2007, p. 526)''

``Lampelet al. (2009) note the lack of frameworks to inform research into processes of learning from rare events .. As failures are often stigmatized, those involved may refuse to acknowledge failure, fear of punishment may prevent openness, and ignoring failures may be an organizational norm''

A number of excellent points regarding Implementing inquiry recommendations and change management too, including that there is little effort to learn from others' incidents (isomorphic learning).

Crisis research has a number of aspects that may be unconventional in other domains:
- studies are often retrospective
- data can be difficult to access, or can even be traumatizing

Trust has 3 domain (knowledge, based on duty):
- articulate (can be completely defined, e.g. in contract)
- authentic (aware of distrust and allowing for balance with benefits)
- basic (what is expected and thus often unspoken e.g. that results are reproducible)

Trustworthiness then has 3 classes covering 10 dimensions (measurements):
- Justice
  - Transparency and explainability
  - Fairness, diversity and non-descrimination
  - Generalisability
- Security
  - Privacy
  - Data Governance
  - Safety
  - Accountability (answerable)
- Depedence
  - Reproducibility etc
  - Reliability and robustness
  - Sustainability (long-term prospect)

These are then further broken down into 33 implementation models and 106 schemes/tools (60 plus 46 schemes) to deliver any specified TAI outcome

Main themes:
- leveraging a nodal body for coordinated decision-making
- strategies and planning
- adaptation
- resource management
- coordination
- monitoring

Emergency response board predated Covid-19 but departure of standard operating procedure resulted from pandemic and so ERB became central in communication across organisation - centralised deicions-maing hierachy - ``The new centralized decision-making hierarchy allowed for large-scale changes to be implemented and for resources to be reallocated and coordinated across groups more quickly than before''

``Planning and preparedness by the university early in the pandemic allowed room for future adaptations to varying situations under uncertainty ... strategizing and planning led directly to the tracking of relevant data and monitoring of processes accordingly by decision-makers''

Adaptation includes:
- repurposing of resources
- reprioritisation (e.g. from pre-pandemic focuses to pandemic focus; later surface disinfection to social distancing)
- technological innovations
- flexibility with new workflows and routines

Resource management:
- Reallocation of existing resources
- Establishing inventory
- Rationing

Coordination, communication via ERB but also Interdepartmental coordination (communication channels via ERB)
Nexus for data colleciton

Monitoring of internal and external dynamics, including monitoring metrics following a decision and then applying adaptation given new findings - example of monitoring hand sanitiser stations

``Through the ERB, policy changes and decisions were able to raise the adaptive capacity of the University, by increasing the effectiveness of both top-down mandates and bottom-up, grassroots, efforts. Top-down decisions from University administration, such as changes in course modality, were rendered more effective by coordinated efforts from now-connected individual departments to enable such changes. Similarly, bottom-up decisions were enabled through coordinated efforts between different departments.''

Very much the agile aspect of agile stability. I'm not sure how successful the new hierachy would be regarding the previously `normal' day to day function - with many different priorities - for example, negative impacts on individual building managers (IBDs). However, this case adapted the existing structure - so could adapt back for stable conditions.

Useful for semi structured interview protocol -  the interview was designed to elicit capabilities that have been previously described as underpinning resilient performance in complex systems (Hollnagel, Woods, Leveson, 2006; Hollnagel and Woods, 2005; Hollnagel and Woods, 2006). These capabilities include monitoring, anticipating, communication and coordination, and maintaining readiness to respond (Hollnagel, Paries, Wreathall, Woods, 2011). Additionally, the questions probed for instantiations of adaptation as responses to situations that deviated from the expected, and for which ready plans or protocols were absent.

Also, as action taking tends to occur in body of organisation, sensemakers are exposed doubly to nonsensical decisions - this paper goes into detail about how sensemakers and action makers within organisation respond to decisions that don't make sense

Used not to be such a problem because processes were slower, action takers could repair, remake, and rework the decisions locally, take effective action, generate results, and cover up their ``non compliance'' [a bit like ``shadow IT'' Schwartz2017, or street-level bureaucrat Peters2022].

Set out a range of hypotheses based on these theories and perform meta analysis to test against 205 emprircal studies in the literature which analyse the effects of organisational feedback

Carnegie perspective -> bounded rationality (Simon, Cyert, March) - organisational
In line with Prospect Theory (which is theory of individual choice): predicts loss aversion for performance below aspirations and risk aversion for performance above aspirations, with the value function being concave for gains and convex for losses and about twice as steep for losses as for gains (Kahneman, Tversky, Greve)

``decision behavior is likely also influenced by individual differences. Such differences can be demographic, for instance, the decision-maker's age, gender, education, disposition, affect, mood, or information processing (Trepel et al., 2005; Pachur et al., 2008, 2017; Hönl et al., 2017; Gächter et al., 2022)'' [sensemaking / orientation ?]

Other individual differences that affect decision making are (gives citations for these):
- self-efficacy
- power
- narcissism
- regulatory focus
- overconfidence

Behavioral Agency Model (BAM) (Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia, 1998) (individual incentives) predicts that executives will react conservatively to organizational performance above aspirations because they expect a gain in wealth  (Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia, 1998) and any additional risk-taking on behalf of the organization might jeopardize this personal gain. When firm performance is below aspirations, decision-makers anticipate loss to personal wealth and, due to loss aversion, are willing to engage in greater organizational risk-taking.

Codes up the reports (another useful example of qualitative analysis) and performs correlation between perfomance and decision maker response

From the results they argue:
- decision-makers overestimate the quality of their competance regarding knowledge gained by job experience, have many biases and thus they are less open to performance feedback (self-enhancing interpretation of performance feedback)
- decision makers with high domain expertise are less prone to such biases because they have gained codified knowledge with more explicit rules (more likely to perform problemistic search with performance below aspirations)
- incentives make decision makers less complacent when performance is above aspirations, but also less ambitious and less risk-taking and as such are more likely to search for solutions

Identifies a notional model of how the process from discovering new information to creating a product (e.g. a presentation) is undertaken. This has two large loops - foraging and reality/policy, which includes sensemaking. These each comprise smaller loops which, in the foraging loop pull into external data, identifies that which is likely to be relevant (it goes into the shoebox) and then pulls out the relevant evidence. The reality/policy/sensemaking loop puts the evidence into the schema before creating a hypothesis. This route is the bottom up process. There is a top-down process that may arise from feedback on the product, or counter evidence that may then result in a reexamination of different loops. 

Their figure illustrates this is multiple loops between increasingly refined information and different types of process (search (both external and various internal to the process), filter, read, extract, schematize, build case and tell story, as well as re-evaluate).

Talk about leverage points (mostly pain points) that emerge. In the foraging loop these are the costs that are incurred in searching, understanding, etc (there's more detail on this). In the sensemaking loop these are:
- Span of attention for evidence and hypotheses
- Generation of alternative hypotheses
- Confirmation bias
It is these leverage points that technologies may be developed for improving the production of novel intelligence from massive data.},

  abstract         = {Decision-making under uncertainty is important for managing human-natural systems in a changing world. A major source of uncertainty is linked to the multi-actor settings of decisions with poorly understood values, complex relationships, and conflicting management approaches. Despite general agreement across disciplines on co-producing knowledge for viable and inclusive outcomes in a multi-actor context, there is still limited conceptual clarity and no systematic understanding on what co-production means in decision-making under uncertainty and how it can be approached. Here, we use content analysis and clustering to systematically analyse 50 decision-making cases with multiple time and spatial scales across 26 countries and in 9 different sectors in the last decade to serve two aims. The first is to synthesise the key recurring strategies that underpin high quality decision co-production across many cases of diverse features. The second is to identify important deficits and opportunities to leverage existing strategies towards flourishing co-production in support of decision-making. We find that four general strategies emerge centred around: promoting innovation for robust and equitable decisions; broadening the span of co-production across interacting systems; fostering social learning and inclusive participation; and improving pathways to impact. Additionally, five key areas that should be addressed to improve decision co-production are identified in relation to: participation diversity; collaborative action; power relationships; governance inclusivity; and transformative change. Characterising the emergent strategies and their key areas for improvement can help guide future works towards more pluralistic and integrated science and practice.},
  comment          = {Interesting paper characterising approaches to co-production for decision making.

Analyse 50 cases of decision-making that involved multi-actor settings. Identified 9 features in 3 groups, each feature has 4 qualitative levels:
- Motivation
  - Framing (problem formulation, decision scoping, ...)
  - Solving (assessing scenarios, evaluating options, ...)
  - Acting (implementing, communication, monitoring, ...)
- Setting
  - Actor (stakeholder groups)
  - Timing (when, frequency)
  - Interaction (direction of information circulation)
- Impact (intended)
  - Power (ability to create/resist change, influence, conflict, cooperation)
  - Politics (governance, who should do what)
  - Change (guidance of transformation on the ground)

From these they identified 4 clusters, types of strategy:
- Innovation (often universities working with societal actors, mainly eliciting information, limited opportunities for social learning and bottom-up co-production)
- Diversification (broadening span of actors e.g. with real world problems, funded beyond science programmes, organisations beyond universities, knowledge exchange between experts, decision makers and citizens, mostly theorising and informing policy)
- Collaboration (social learning, common ground through negotiation, wider actor groups include often marginalised, inform policy but less co-manage transformation)
- Transformation (thinking through change and guiding implementation, understanding of power, actors expectations and responsibilities)

Draw on several best practice cases to identify challenges and their opportunities. The 5 opportunties are:
- Create trusted knowledge from multiple sources
- Empower learning and collaboration
- Understand and manage power dynamics with all actors
- Account for politics and inclusive governance
- Link knowledge with action for transformative change

Conclude that there may be more strategies to discover through future studies and that no single right way to do co-production of decisions},

  comment          = {propose structure for studying formation and evolution of dynamic capabilities in organisations

Worth investigating how much have studies supported the hypotheses in this paper?

Operating routines are modified in organisations by activities that arise from the organisation's dynamic capabilities

This paper defines dynamics capabilities (differently to Teece et al) as learned and stable pattern of activity that generates and modifies routines ...

It also focuses on learning mechanisms as the source of  dynamic capabilities.

Knowledge is processed by the organisation in 3 ways:
- experience (tacit) accumulation
- knowledge articulation
- knowledge codification

The evolution of routines through dynamic capabilities is cyclic:
Variation -> Selection -> Replication -> Retention -> Variation -> Selection ...

Learning investments lead to dynamic capabilities building:
- Lowest investment is in experience accumulation
- Highest is in knowledge codification

They make the following observations:
- tacit accumulation is vulnerable to personnel turnover
- identification and diffusion of best practise is a greater investment
- highly codified knowledge can be rolled out (replication) at greater speed
- highly articulated and codified knowledge may have more inertia
- adaptation of knowledge to local conditions can reduce inertia
- the retention of high articulated and codified knowledge may depress the likelihood of new changes being proposed, considered or evaluated

The level of investment in learning depends on three broad categories:
1. environmental conditions, such as speed of change in industry
2. organisational features, e.g. how much does the culture allow for betting on change?
3. task features, such as:

   - heterogeneity (hypothesise that when a set of tasks is more heterogeneous, better outcomes result from explicit articulation and codification, rather than just tacit accumulation)
   - causal ambiguity (hypothesise that, where it is more ambiguous what impact decisions and actions had on performance, explicit articulation and codification will be more effective)

suggest guiding principles:
1. codification should aim at developing and transferring ``know why'' as well as ``know how''
2. codification efforts should be emphasized at an appropriate time in the course of learning
3. codified guidance should be tested by adherence
4. create supporting structure to enable but control departure from guidance

The world is not dichotomous (the market - private goods - and the state - public goods), stuctures are more complex. Buchanan introduced ``club'' (Ostrom: ``toll'') goods but more widely there is not considerable empirical evidence of how ``common pool resources'' are managed by groups of participants. There are 7 broad types of rule that operate in these cases

Studies finding that polycentric decision-making systems (e.g. policing arrangements) have demonstrated that, contrary to theory, these are more, not less, efficient than if they are all amalgamated together

``earlier theories of rational, but helpless, individuals who are trapped in social dilemmas are not supported by a large number of studies using diverse methods ... ``rational choice theory'' is not a broad theory of human behavior but rather a useful model to predict behavior in a particular situation - a highly competitive market for private goods''

Individuals are boundedly rational, learn and use heuristics. However ``In eras of rapid change or sudden shocks ... heuristics may not enable individuals to achieve high payoffs''. They also adopt norms, and meta norms of groups they regularly interact with.

Environment strongly affects behaviour

User-governed systems show better performance [over state governed, I presume]. Trust is crucial to overcoming social dilemmas. Cooperation here (public goods and common pool resources) requires:
1. ability to communicate
2. knowledge of reputation
3. knowledge marginal return per capita (high -> trust)
4. cost of entering exiting a situation (low -> trust)
5. time horizon (long -> better cooperation)
6. agreed sanctions (good when agreed by participants, cooperation reduced when imposed)

``externally imposed regulation ... ``crowded out'' voluntary behavior to cooperate''

Key findings:
- Transformative innovation policy practice adheres to the producer-centric innovation paradigm
- A current weakness in transformative innovation policy is the lack of consideration of the actual locus of the problem and innovation
- Citizens innovate but their underlying motivations differ from producers

The current innovation paradigm is producer-centric

Producer is thought of as organisations and consumer is citizens

Citizen innovators are barely considered

This paper argues that, especially for behaviour change, citizens should be enabled to be innovators

This is not just public sector bodies including citizens, but innovation should be bottom up led by citizens with public sector support innovation, scale up, diffusion etc where necessary

Considers Transformative Innovation Policy (TIP), which is currently insufficient and needs to be developed to include citizens as source of innovation

narrow TIP - academia and industry towards addressing societal problems and closely associated with mission- or challenge-oriented innovations (Mazzucato etc)

broad TIP- change of socio-technical system, which requires engagement by multiple actors

use broad TIP as a starting point for formally including citizens as innovation source

``literature on wicked problems has from its very beginning critiqued science-based policy approaches as too narrow for addressing societal problems''

``even when a problem linked to unsustainable consumption appears to be situated on an individual consumer level, it is still affected by higher-order social, economic and cultural factors''

Study Vinnova funding allocation and finds ``The locus of innovation is on scientific and technological breakthroughs whereas innovations that lead to social and behavioural changes receive little attention despite they form a key part of sustainability transitions''

Key themes include:
- we evolved in a world of radical uncertainty and are excellent at making decisions under these circumstances
- we use a reference narrative to support our decision making
- its important to ask ``what is going on here'' [I'm not sure they ever use the word ``sensmaking'']
- small world v large world

Summary of Herbert Simon's work p135. 
Satisifcing - heuristics are good enoug  p150 [I think Gigerenzer2004 is better here] - to optimise in uncertainty requires making simplifying assumption which are likely to be wrong - optimisation leads to poor outcomes
Simon says that its not possible to gather or process all the necessary information to optimise - some economist have interpreted Simon's Bounded Rationality as it being too costly to gather and process information.

Klein1998:
Experienced decision makers do not compare options but choose the first workable option p151

Small worlds:
This is what was often studied in decision research - fully defined problems with single solutions. One can use axiomatic rationality

Large worlds:
The real world, problems are ill-defined. Requires evolutionary rationality. social and cultural practices are result of evolutionary processes p163
Characteristics that are considered irrational or biases in small world experiments are necessary in a large world with radical uncertainty and are evolutionary in origin p165
Emotion is a necessary heuristic, story of a brain injury patient who felt no emotion and could not make decisions p171

Common errors, mistake: p183-4
- quantification for understanding
- forecasting for planning
- aspirations for strategy
- motivational proselytization for boardroom debate

Action is not explanation p267
Reasoning is not decision making, reasoning tends to come after the fact p268
Communicative rationality (MercierS2017)

Analogue economies - models of the economy that can be run but ultimately need so many assumptions that they will eventually fail. [I feel like digital twins could go this way]

``We live in a world of incomplete markets in which there are simply no price signals to guide us back to an efficient equilibrium ... models used by central banks perform quite well when nothing very much is happening and fail dramatically when something big occurs...'' p349

Experience of models is that they are not used for decision making but for justification of already determined course of action p370

DavenportM2012 study of NASA and how good decisions are made, arose out of Challenger disaster (see quote in DavenportM2012) p374

Argue that economics should be like Waze - the ability to rapidly access information suggestion where there may be problems and possible work arounds p396

Some economists, e.g. Becker at Chicago school tend to start from the assumptions rather than the observations p381-2

``As economists we are not noeclassical or Neo-Keynsian, or Austrian or socialist or behavioural. But we are willing to draw on any or all of these schools of thought if they offer relevant insight into the context of a particular problem...'' p397

Chicago school tries to eliminate radical uncertainty by leaving it to the risk market p420-1 However, absence of volatility is not absence of risk p421-2. Schemes that demand certainty become, as a result, more risky e.g. pensions p423

Working with radical uncertainty means strategy that includes warning triggers, buffers and recovery plans p424 ``Embrace uncertainty; Avoid risk'' p432},

- story
- map

- plan
- mental models

and thus accounts for data and guides search for data - it reflects a person's compiled experiences

``The frame may be in error, but until feedback or some other form of information makes the error evident, the frame is the foundation for understanding the situation and for deciding what to do about it'' Beach, 1997, p24

``Sensemaking is motivated by the person's goals and by the need to balance the data with the frame - a person experiences confusion in having to consider data that appear relevant and yet are not integrated''

Make and demonstrate examples of 9 assertions:
1. "Sensemaking is the process of fitting data into a frame and fitting a frame around the data"
2.  data are inferred using the frame
3. frame is inferred from a few anchors
4. inferences use abduction as well as logical deduction
5. sensemaking usually ceases when data and frame are brought into congruence
6. experts use a richer repertoire of frames (but same reasoning as novices)
7. sensemaking for functional understanding (what to do) and abstract understanding
8. primarily just-in-time mental models
9. sensemaking takes different forms each with its own dynamics

Weick 1995 and Lundberg 2000 argued that effective sensemaking relies more heavily on plausibility, pragmatics, coherence and reasonableness- criteria used by abduction - than on accuracy

Just-in-time mental models are non-comprehensive models of how things work assembled on the spot, e.g. for troubleshooting - we make some inferences beyond our limited knowledge and ``cobble together'' a notion of what is going on. Experts therefore can be better at identifying causes and solutions because they have more accurate and comprehensive models, even though they may also be assembling these on the spot.

framing, re-framing, filter, interpret, testing and improving cyclically

There are different forms of sensemaking, including:
- connecting data to a frame
- elaborating the frame
- questioning the frame
- preserving the frame
- comparing frames
- re-framing
- seeking a frame

These all operate in different ways

Suggest how this theory can be applied to both decision support systems and training programmes and outline testable aspects of the theory with hypotheses

Present a heuristic model of change that involves four phases: 
- exploitation
- conservation
- creative destruction
- renewal

which constitute an adaptive cycle

Change is episodic, caused by interactions of fast and slow variables

Attributes occur differently at different scales, the shift from processes at one range of scales to another is nonlinear

Stabilising and destabilising forces interact - both are vital to different aspects (productivity and biogeochemical cycles versus diversity, resilience and opportunity)

Management and policies much be flexible, adaptive and experimental

Resilience has two definitions
- efficiency, control, constancy, predictability (engineering resilience) (tractable mathematics, equilibrium steady state, deductive)
- persistence, adaptiveness, variability, unpredictability (ecosystem resilience) (applied maths and ecology, inductive)

The latter is at the heart of designing for sustainability

Traditional ecosystem succession has two functions
 - exploitation (rapid colonisation) - r phase
- conservation (accumulation and storage) - K phase

Likens these to entrepreneurial market and bureaucratic hierarchy
Later understandings add
- release (caused by agents of disturbance such as wildfire; creative destruction) - $\Omega$ phase
- reorganisation (innovation and restructuring) - $\alpha$ phase

Each shift in the cycle between phases changes the 
- potential (for change, what is possible), and 
- connectedness (how much system controls its own destiny)

within the system. There is a 3rd dimension that increases and decreases during the succession:
- resilience (vulnerability to unexpected disturbances)

Novelty and experimentation are possible when connectedness is low and resilience is high - at the transition from the $\alpha$ and r phases, which is a phase of great uncertainty [is this similar to the transition phase described in Geels2004?]

Apply the metaphor to ecological and economic/organisational systems. "Fail" to discover useful exceptions in specific large human organisations. Do identify some exceptions in physical, biological and some human systems [c.f. KayK2020 ``absence of volatility is not absence of risk p421-2''].

``AI research is embedded in a socio-economic system that is divorced from anything deeper than winning its own game'' - traces this from the Age of Enlightenment, Descartes and Hobbes, and the humanistic values that built the AI. Physicalism, which says experience is a byproduct of matter and can't tell you what it feels to be happy, or an AI. The only thing you know for sure is what you experience, your consciousness, but physicalism says that this is a by-product of something that you cannot know is real - especially given increasing quantum knowledge.

Argues that we therefore need a very different perspective, beyond values because ``culturally we lack a story as to why values even matter to begin with'', a deeper level of reality to align with

Existential risk ``generator functions'':
- rivalrous dynamics
- complicated systems consuming their complex substrate
Argues that these in turn are generated by physicalism

Discusses different perspectives of metaphysics:
- philosophical idealism - reality is fundamentally a mental process, a transpersonal mind, the world begins with perceptions
- panpsychism - consciousness and the physical world are fundamental and simply phase states of each other

If we orient towards quality - towards the experience rather and quantity - for the foundation of our cutural stories we may hope to build better [AI], although not a panacea.

Climate breakdown has heightened attention to uneven anthropogenic use and abuse of the planet's biosphere and common pool resources. Recent arguments by climate scholars suggest that various planetary boundaries have already been breached, resulting in dramatic and harmful socio-ecological consequences. These trends raise crucial questions of equity and justice, especially concerning responsibilities and impacts. By centring Global South perspectives, prevailing ideologies promoting hyperconsumption, overproduction and waste are interrogated. The incommensurability of socioecological justice with ongoing unsustainable extractive and exploitative economic growth paradigms, which contribute to further transgressions of planetary boundaries, underscore the urgency of decolonising underlying colonial-capitalist ideologies and practices. This entails a fundamental reformulation of paradigms to envision a more just and sustainable future, one that dismantles oppressive systems and advances justice-oriented praxis.},

Aim is to advise on AI-enabled decision making but many studies used are not about AI

Too much information can lead to worse decision outcomes, as well as making more decisions or difficult and decrease satisfaction

Also look at amount of choice, uncertainty, decision difficult, variety, entropy (high when lots of options of equal probability) on decision outcomes

Probably loads of interesting nuggets in here, its very thorough

Provides a table of advice for providing more or less choice under different conditions (much more detail in paper):
- General - decision makers profer more choice but provide less as decisions increase in difficulty or complexity
- Complexity, Difficulty, Uncertainty - when low give more choice, when high give less
- Information relevance - even too much relevant information can be detrimental
- Cognitive Effort - when high give less choice
- Familiarity - when low give less choice
- Entropy - decrease by highlighting unequal likelihood of options or attributes
- Variety - less about increasing number of options and more about increasing the distinction between options},

``AOT can be defined as the disposition to actively search for and give fair treatment to possibilities other than the one we initially favor. Therefore, its main difference from rational thinking style is that it deals not only with the quantity of thinking (i.e. whether a person tends to think a lot before making important decisions), but also the quality, or the direction of thinking (i.e. whether person tends to look for counterevidence and reasons why he/she might be wrong which is a direct antidote to some prevalent reasoning errors). Empirically, this thinking disposition was found to be related to a range of indicators of rational thinking - it correlates negatively with a wide range of cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, sunk cost effect, outcome bias, belief bias and others''},

We hire, train, and reward employees as individuals. And, yet, we have great faith that individuals thrown together into a team with little thought devoted to team composition, training and development, and leadership will be effective and successful''

Reviews:

Critical team processes and emergent states and how they contribute to team effectiveness:
- teams with better individual teamwork KSAs, competencies, and functions will be more effective
- teams with better regulatory-process dynamics that express these competencies as synchronized individual and team action will be more effective
- factors that influence the development of self-regulation can be adapted to develop team regulation
-  team leadership and team-training interventions are key leverage points for shaping the development of team regulatory-process competencies

Aligning and leveraging team processes: Team design
- Hackman (1992) normative model provides a basic heuristic that identifies critical factors that need to be considered when team work systems are created
  - more research required

Team training:
- cross training, forms of simulation-based training, and team adaptation-coordination-CRM training all evidence sufficient research-based support to justify recommending them as credible and effective team-training techniques

Team development:
- inconsistent findings for the effectiveness of team-building interventions attest to the challenge of change
- a ripe target for systematic and rigorous research

Leadership:
-  theory and evidence support leaders as a key leverage point for enhancing team effectiveness

Conclusions are around building relationships so that people have support to help themselves. Discussion and findings that these approaches are both cheaper and have more success.

Experiments:
1. Family Life - `Life', work with families within a community to support their aspirations and lives
2. Growing Up - Loops', find that young people want to be included and have experiences so experiment with ways to provide this
3. Good Work - `Backr', designing a new approach to finding work
4. Good Health - Wellogram", the health system focuses on illness, not the whole person, how can people be helped to help themselves?
5. Aging Well - `Circle', older people are a resource, create the conditions for people to address their own loneliness

Principles:
1. Vision: the good life
2. Capabilities
3. Above all, relationships
4. Connect multiple forms of resource
5. Create possibility
6. Open: take care of everyone

Developing RittelW1973's typology of 2 problems, adding in a third:
* tame
* wicked
* critical

It considers leaders' roles in each and also different types of authority and the corresponding decision-making approach and associate compliance (based on other's research):
* management <- process <- calculated compliance
* leadership <- question <- normative compliance
* command <- answer <- coercive compliance

Consider the two dimensional model of culture (Douglas) that is based on:
* grid - the significance of roles and rules
* group - the impostrance of the group

This defines 4 cultural architypes (heuristics rather than a mirror of society), which can also be considered as modes of solutions. These cultures are self-supporting and internally consistent since they perceive the world through their own lens such that hierarchists, egalitarians and individualists see problems as a consequence of others not meeting their location on the grid/group axes (Fatalists have given up and see no ability to change anything.
):
* hierarchy - high grid and high group - good at decision-making and rule enforcement but rules and targets tend divert the solution to a different problem. They are often not innovative or can degenerate to corruption
* egalitarian - low grid and high group - good at generating debate and rooting out corruption but not delivering decisions
* individualism - low grid and low group - believe in markets, rational choice and are innovative but we are not as rational as we think and markets can fail
* fatalism - high grid and low group - don't believe they have any power or than anything can change

A Tame Problem may be complicated but is:
* resolvable through unilinear acts
* likely to have occurred before
* there is only a limited degree of uncertainty
A management decision-maker can apply process to solve these problems
Associated compliance is likely to be calculated, related to `rational' organisation such as companies 

A Critical Problem, eg a `crisis', is presented as self-evident in nature:
* very little time for decisionmaking and action
* virtually no uncertainty about what needs to be done - at least in the behaviour of the decision-maker
A commander decision-maker uses authoritarianism, Command, to take the required decisive action - that is to provide the answer to the
problem, not to engage processes (management) or ask questions (leadership)
Associated compliance is likely to be coercive, based on physical power

A Wicked Problem is more complex, rather than just complicated:
* it cannot be removed from its environment, solved, and returned without affecting the environment
* there is no clear relationship between cause and effect
* inherently political (not scientific or rational)
The leader's role with a Wicked Problem is to ask the right questions rather than provide the right answers because the answers may not be self-evident and will require a collaborative process to make any kind of progress
Associated compliance is likely to be normative, related to instiutions or organisations based on shared values

Solutions can be:
* elegant - can be solved, tend to be `single mode' solutions - within one cultural architype, scientific solutions 
* clumsy - accept imperfection and making do, seek no regrets solutions and common ground, are arrived at by involving all cultural modes, other terms include incrementalism and `muddling through'

What each architype brings (except fatalists, we don't need to worry about them):
Individualists:
I1. Positive Deviance not negative Accuiescence - deviating from the mainstream culture with positive outcomes
I2. Negative Capability - being comfortable with uncertainty
I3. Constructive Dissent not Destructive Consent (irresponsible followship) - will to challenge authority
Egalitarians:
E1. Collective IQ not Individual Genius - believe that best solutions come from community
E2. Community of Fate not Fatalist Community - recognise importance of building social capital, communities with responsibility individual shared
E3. Empathy not Egotism - become an anthropologist of your own organisation
Hierarchists:
H1. Questions not Answers - being a leader
H2. Relationships not Structures - its the relationships that matter
H3. Reflection not Reaction - don't react (act too soon), or do nothing but reflect on what is known (see Schwartz2017 ``decisions should be deferred until the last possible moment'')

Decision-makers will often try to avoid leadership, because questioning implies that
1. the leader does not have the answer
2. the leader's role is to make the followers face up to their responsibilities
3. the `answer' to the problem is going to take a long time to construct and that it will only ever be `more appropriate' rather than `the best'
4. it will require constant effort to maintain

Discusses Aristotle's phronesis - the Wisdom to acknowledge that the situation is not like any other. This arises from `apperception' - the ability to relate new experiences to previous experiences. [relates to analogy in Klein2017] which requires reflective learning to understand patterns

Worth reading through more thoroughly, but 

Defines open AI and identifies what is and what is not open about Open Source AI:
* Development frameworks - Pytorch (Meta) and Tensorflow (Google) etc ``allow Meta, Google, and those steering framework development to standardize AI construction so it's compatible with their own company platforms .. to shape the work practices of researchers and developers such that new AI models can be easily integrated and commercialized''
* Compute - CUDA (Nvidia), Triton (OpenAI, currently only works on Nvidia GPUs), Google TPUS - ``while some lower level software that optimizes computational power for AI development may be open
in that one can inspect their code, in practice, this software is often designed for efficiency in proprietary hardware environments, and is developed and governed by companies selling compute resources and/or licensing AI models''
* Data - ``OpenAI/Microsoft have refused to disclose important information about the training data used to shape GPT-4'', others are open, hosted on AWS, but there are issues of extraction and intellectual property, colonial context of data exploitation. Data labelling often opaque and use proprietary platforms
* Labor - labelling is opaque and has ``precarity, harm, and colonial dynamics of these labor practices'' and is poorly paid [also: GrayS2019]
* AI models - even if weights are available, this is a loose application of the term `open' when data sets are unavailable (e.g. GPT), fine-tuning is less computationally intensive: the leak of LLaMA makes AI mroe accessible but also benefits META

Lots of detail on OpenAI

``openness'' in AI does not directly lead to innovation, despite claims to the contrary; certainly not when significant industry presence, corporate ownership of the costly infrastructure needed to make new AI systems, and corporate capture of the field of academic AI research forms the backdrop for `open' AI research. Evidence indicates these factors are already contributing to the development of an AI monoculture, incentivizing the creation of only the kinds of AI systems that industry is most invested in and able to profit from''

propose returning to the idea of AI as a theoretical tool for cognitive science

Cites works that defines `kyriarchy' as an intersectional generalisation of the notion of `patriarchy', i.e., a complex system of oppressions that include (intersections of) racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc. 

Provides a list of different (not mutually exclusive) meanings of the word AI

In the 1970s and 80s, `AI' was also used to refer to the aim of using computational tools to develop theories of natural cognition (among other uses). ``AI is one of the cognitive sciences'' e.g. Simon 1983

``The thesis of computationalism implies that it is possible in principle to understand human cognition as a form of computation. However, this does not imply that it is possible in practice to computationally (re)make cognition''

Defines and criticises ``Makeism'':  building cognition is possible and sufficient for being able to explain it etc. However, ``(re)making human-like or human-level minds is computationally intractable (even under highly idealised conditions)''.

``any attempts to scale up to situations of real-world, human-level complexity (medium to large n) will necessarily consume an astronomical amount of resources (such as time and number of samples''

``any factual AI system created in the short-run (say, within the next few decades or so) is so astronomically unlikely to be anything like a human mind, or even a coherent capacity that is part of that mind, that claims of `inevitability' of AGI within the foreseeable future are revealed to be false and misleading'' - yet no-one is sacked for claiming this inevitability

``if one were to test these AIs rigorously and unbiasedly for human-likeness, it would quickly become evident that they behave qualitatively differently from humans''

Simon suggests that human-like/level thinking machines are realisable and Karpathy et al quote Fehnman supporting makeism

Confusion of models (explanans) for the thing modelled (explanandum) - the model is not necessarily how things work in the real world.

A small group of people with ADHD, autism, dyslexia and dyspraxia tried various tests. Found that extra time wasn't the issue. 

Not being able to move on from a question that makes no sense, e.g. a multi-choice with no option to respond the way the candidate feels is correct for them

Being affected by the noise of inconsistencies in the numerical reasoning tests that weren't related to the question (but also demonstrates a desired skills) or otherwise able to ignore irrelevant but incongruent detail

``Neurotypical culture privileges acquiescence and compliance over 100\% accuracy. I know many of my neurodivergent colleagues feel chastised for pointing out bigger picture incongruencies or potential improvements to detail that colleagues see as ``irrelevant'', but actually fine tuning is exactly how to achieve exceptional performance in many roles. Neurodiversity is thriving in work cultures where a specialist thinker is encouraged to deep dive into the detail or purpose of a project or product and isn't overruled for being pedantic or asking big picture ``so what'' questions. Bake our critique into your process and the quality will improve.''

  comment          = {I love this paper. Decisions literature often separates different perspectives, particularly the ``heuristics and biases'' (HB) approach to (mainly) laboratory-based experiments from the ``naturalistic decision-making'' (NDM) approach, which attempts to study decisions in the wild by observing and performing post-event analysis on real-world decisions, often in high-stakes scenarios such as firefighting and nuclear power plants. This paper brings together the key authors Klein, see also Klein2017 and Kahneman2011) from each of those schools (of thought). They find that their theories are not in conflict, but instead illustrate different aspects of decision-making.

Neat histories of both approaches are given.

Models for strategies in field settings (NDM) include:
* recognition-based decision making (Klein)
* cognitive continuum model (Hammond et al)
* image theory (Beach)
* search for dominance structures (Montgomery)
* skills/rules/knowledge framework and decision ladder (Rasmussen)

``Members of the HB community are of course aware of the existence of skill and expertise, but they tend to focus on flaws in human cognitive performance. Members of the NDM community know that professionals often err, but they tend to stress the marvels of successful expert performance''

``The members of the HB community are mostly based in academic departments, and they tend to favor well-controlled experiments in the laboratory. The members of the NDM community are typically practitioners who operate in ``real-world'' organizations''

See quote from Simon 1992 (p155)  for a concise definition of skilled intuition that they both endorse

Some environments allow experts to make successful predictions, others, like the financial industry, do not. 

``wicked environments'' are those in which wrong intuitions are likely to develop

Recognition requires enough exposure. Notes that note many examples are required in some cases such as discriminating dogs from cats [interesting considering AI]

Effective expertise enables good predictions if:
* The environment has high validity [I interpret this as being an environment in which the learner can validate their predictions] 
* There is enough opportunity to practise the skill 

Shanteau says [I think this is clearer]:
* the predictability of outcomes
* the amount of experience
* the availability of good feedback

``A common genre of business literature celebrates successful leaders who made strategic decisions on the basis of gut feelings and intuitions that they did not adequately check, but many of these successes owe more to luck than to genius (Rosenzweig, 2007)'' [c.f. Teece2022]

``The HB claim is not that intuitions that arise in heuristics are always incorrect, only that they are less trustworthy than intuitions that are rooted in specific experiences'' [c.f. BlettnerKL2023]

``The safe way to evaluate the probable accuracy of a judgment is by considering the validity of the environment in which the judgment was made as well as the judge's history of
learning the rules of that environment''

``mechanical'' judgements outperform human ones when:
a. validity is so low that human difficulties in detecting weak regularities and in maintaining consistency of judgment are critical
b. validity is very high, in highly predictable environments, where ceiling effects are encountered and occasional lapses of attention can cause humans to fail

An effective algorithms requires:
a.  an adequate list of variables that will be used
b. a reliable and measurable criterion
c. a body of similar cases
d. a cost/benefit ratio that warrants the investment in the algorithmic approach
e. a low likelihood that changing conditions will render the algorithm obsolete

Endorse Klein's premortem method for reducing overconfidence and improving decisions

``Subjective confidence is therefore an unreliable indication of the validity of intuitive judgments and decisions [or the validity of AI algorithm outputs]},

One of the main themes is how experts use recognition-primed decision-making:
* experience of a situation
* determine if situation is typical [c.f. role of system 1, Kahneman2011]

Recognition has by-products:
* cues
* action options
* plausible goals
* expectations

Components also include:
* diagnosis (story building)
* action evaluation (mental simulation

This work asserts: p287
* experience counts
* expertise depends on perceptual skills
* the computer metaphor of thinking is incomplete
* skilled problem solvers and decision makers are themselves scientists and experimenters
* skilled problem solvers and decision makers are chameleons
* the sources of power described in this book operate in ways that are not analytical (they are generative, allow the redefinition of goals, trade accuracy for speed, build on experience, are used in context)

Klein developed the pre-mortem method which uses mental simulation to overcome the risks of ignoring vital information because it doesn't fit our current mental model. Marvin Cohen has apparently been working on methods of training that also avoid these pitfalls. p69-70

Pierre Wack developed decision scenarios rather than forecasts and conventional scenarios. Decision scenarios represent different ways to see the same situation and can highlight the unlikely assumptions on which executives build their mental models p72-3 See also work of Peter Schwartz

RPD model: decision makers usually look for first work for option. Mental simulation allows them to spot weaknesses and find ways to overcome them

Mental simulation performs several purposes: explanation, testing ideas, finding solutions
Simulations usually have around 3 variables and 6 transitions
Mental simulations can be improved using methods such as premortem and decision scenarios

Rational choice is compensatory because weaknesses in one dimension are offset by strengths in others. Non-conpensatory models include elimination by aspects, and face off p94

Study of decision points in field experiments found that most use recognition and only a few are comparative p99-100

Goals are often ill-defined and goal modification occurs as part of problem solving. Goal setting is part of problem representation p124, 129 Means-ends analysis looks at the gap between current situation and the desired ends this as a new goal p136

There is no evidence that people generate the problem space except in well-defined problems. This means that AI is not analogous because it operates in the problem space p132

In industrial settings supervisors have trouble deciding to abandon BAU p135

The evidence is that brainstorming reduces productivity p143

Experts can see eight things that are invisible to others p147-175
* patterns
* anomalies
* the big picture (situation awareness)
* the way things work
* opportunities and improvisations
* events in the past and future
* very small differences
* their own limitations

``In organisations, much of the knowledge is held within the heads of the workers and is never shared. This is tacit knowledge. In most organizations the culture seems to ignore the expertise that already exists to take it for granted. If the skilled worker retired after 30 years on the job and try to leave with a favorite personal computer, some programs or a set of tools, he or she would be stopped. The organisation knows the value of the equipment. But the organization lets the worker walk out with all of that expertise, which is worth far more than some minor equipment, and never says the word never even notices the loss'' p170

Stories are powerful. They help us make sense of events and can even be natural experiments as they are similar to mental simulations p177-196

Analogues and metaphors are also powerful [I feel this is very much like stories] p197-213
An approach to finding a solution is comparability analysis. The example is from the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where engineers codify their experience to find similar examples when trying to solve problems. This requires defining the system well, finding the closest possible similar system and then taking several further steps assessing whether this is the right choice and if adjustments need to be made. [Seems somewhat like a manual version of case-based reasoning and I wonder if it's more generally useful for I'll defined problems] p203

Instructions can fail because the intent is not as clear as is thought. Teams work well together when they've learned to detect and predict each other's intent and perspectives. Buy communicating intent we are promoting independence and improvisation within the team p222

Essential information when communicating intent [such as explaining the purpose of a piece of work could we use this in research?]: p225
1. Purpose of the task
2. Objective of the task
3. Sequence of steps in the plan
4. Rationale for the plan
5. Key decisions that may have to be made
6. Antigoals (unwanted outcomes)
7. Constraints and other considerations

Ultimately it's good for managers to receive feedback about how good are their communications of intent p231

The team mind is analogous to an individual's mind, it is an intelligent entity. It has cognition and meta cognition. It controls the flow of ideas at this needs to be learned p233-257

Analysing rationally may not apply in many situations: p259-269
* there are no [standard] basic elements to break the problem down to
* rules are ambiguous
* calculations require subjective judgments
* formal analysis can:
  * degenerate into combinatorial explosions
  * interfere with non-rational forms of thinking
  * be prevented by features of natural settings
• consistency is rare in natural settings

The heuristics and biases paradigm is based on tasks in which probabilities can be calculated in advance allowing performance to be measured. However in natural settings and biases may be reduced in experienced decision-makers p272

Popper urged scientist to disconfirm their favorite theories p273

Some believe that decision error doesn't exist and poor outcomes are caused by poor information, experience, goals and maybe design, training and procedures p273

Three categories of decisions that appear to show error: p274
* lack of experience (majority)
* lack of information
* de minimus error: poor mental simulation and explaining away signs of a problem

Stress does not cause bad decisions but it affects the way we process information p275

Lipshitz and Shaul define uncertainty as ``doubt that threatens to block action" p276

Uncertainty, that results in a reluctance to act is when key information is: p276-7
* missing
* unreliable
* ambiguous, inconsistent or conflicting
* too complex to interpret

Uncertainty occurs at the levels of: p277
* Data
* knowledge - drawing inferences about data
* understanding - inferences synthesized into projections, diagnoses and explanations

Great commanders turn and certainty to their advantage decisively yet prudently p279

Expertise is important but can sometimes lead to oversight. People can struggle to learn from experience because cause and effect are not always obvious p280

Society still has many superstitions and politics, health, business e.g. reorganisations for which there's no evidence to success p281

It's difficult to learn from domains that (Shanteau 1992): p282 
* are dynamic
* require the prediction of human behaviour
* have less chance of feedback
* have few repetitions to learn typicalities
* have fewer trials

Better decisions:
* Build expertise - this is easier in some domains than others p282
* better mental simulation e.g. crystal ball p283
* accept error as inevitable - safeguards etc make errors harder to diagnose so are not wholly helpful; make malfunctions more obvious instead p283 [See also Charles Perrow Normal Accidents]},

  title            = {Thinking Fast and Slow},
  comment          = {Discussing findings of research into the psychology of thinking. Each short section ends with sentences using the terms defined in the book in a suggested way to talk about different psychological aspects of thinking

Broadly:
* System 1 (fast; automatic) v System 2 (slow; analytic)
* Econs (consistent; unbiased; [Homo Economicus] [see Frey below]) v Humans (subject to biases and heuristics)
* Experiencing Self (moment by moment) v Remembering Self (summary for each experience)

System 1 and System 2 was originally form Stanovich and West p20

Both systems are involved in attention, but system 2 activities are disrupted when attention is drawn away from them - list of examples of such activities p22

A sentence is more easily understood if it describes what an agent does than if it describes what something is p29

Systen 2 adopts ``task sets'', which are something like groups of tasks to perform an action (example is counting all the f's on the page). ``Exectuive control'' is adopting and terminating these p36-7

``Ego depletion'' occurs because the effort of self control (activiating system 2) is tiring. Even controlling emotional/pain reactions causes ego depletion. The result is less motivation to continue to activate control, although ability to activate control is not impaired (it is different from the effects of cognitive load). p41-3

Flow separates concentration from control of attention p40-1

System 1 creates suggestions for system 2, alerts when anomalies are found. System 2 is `lazy' because if there's no obvious reason to not to accept these suggestions, system 2 doesn't engage in analysing the situation further.

Stanovich and West distinguish between two minds: p48-9
* algorithmic (aligns with intelligence)
* rational (reflective, engaged, checks System 1)

Priming occurs in system 1, associations are triggered and affect behaviour [could this be used in our work more generally, such as using statements, images, etc that trigger a desired reponse?] p50-8

Cognitive ease makes things seem familiar and are also more likely to be believed. When system 1 impressions result in ease, system 2 may not check the suggestions from system 1. Ease can be caused by: p59-64
* repetition
* clear font/visuals
* simple language
* bright colours
* rhymes
This effect is also related to good mood, intuition, creativity, gullability. Increased use of system 2 is related to sadness, vigilance, suspicion and increased effort. p 69

System 1 automatically believes what is experienced, it is only through test (e.g. of plausibility) that engagement of system 2 unables us to unbelieve p81

Priming/believing causes bias towards early information and therefore before discussing an idea, executives should first write down their personal positions on the idea p85

A huge cause of bias and misinterpretation/understanding is that we tend to draw conclusions based on only the available information (what you see is all there is, WYSIATI) as if there is no wider world p85 onwards

Anchors - any value (even something random or not related) can influence our judgement. Suggestion and priming are at play here in system 1 but also subsequent system 2 analysis is influenced. May be countered by thinking about the opposite of the anchor. p119-28

Availability heuristic - the ease with which things come to mind is used as a guide to how frequent such things may be [a substitution of the the question ``how many X are there?'' with ``how easily can I think of Xs?''] p129-36

Availability is also used in assessing risk - more recent exposure to a risk (e.g. on the news) increases our perception of its risk. In the media reporting case, this can lead to an ``availability cascade'' which involves increased reporting with a specific subject and eventually a change of policy on the subject. p 142-4

Interesting discussion about the impacts on policy of citizens' versus experts perceptions of risks p140-1

Affect heuristic - our decisions are largely based on how something makes us feel (``the emotional tail wags the ration dog'' Hardt) [a substitution of any question about X with ``how does X make me feel?''] p 140

System 1 also looks for causes and if possible causal factors are given, base rates are ignored (WYSIATI) - even when base rates (such as relative proportions of two groups) are more strongly influential on outcomes [beware!]. p 166-74

Because system 1 is looking for causes/explanations, we tend to miss the reality of regression to the mean - that extreme outcomes are likely to be followed by outcomes that are closer to the mean. In research controls and placebos are used but the brain doesn't apply such measures [beware!]. p 175-84

Suggests 4 steps to reduce biases in outcome predictions, which forces thinking about assumptions and is better than just predicting on average but will reduce the possibility of predicting extremes: p190, p195
1. estimate the average outcome [see outside view below]
2. find the outcomes that matches your impression of the evidence
3. estimate the correlation between your evidence and the outcome
4. use the correlation to determine how close to move from the average toward your matching outcome (i.e. the lower the correlation, the closer the estimate remains to the average)

Chance is very influential such as in business settings but with hindsight we tend to create a story including changing our view of what we originally thought and the causes of outcomes p199-208 [see also Taleb2006]

Tetlock demonstrated how much of an illusion predicting the future is despite so much value being placed on experts in forecasting p209-21

Meehl showed how simple formulae and checklists (such as Apgar) outperform human prediction in low validity environments [Taleb2007's Extremistan?]. In recruitment, scoring against desired criteria and sticking to these scores has better outcomes. p222-33 [c.f. Eubanks, Widiak on bias in algorithms]

Discussion of collaboration with Klein (KahnmemanK2009) and when to trust intuition. This is down to the environment. p234-44 Low-validity environments: ``intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment'' p 241

Because of WYSIATI, optimism bias, planning fallacy means that we tend to underestimate of the expected duration of a project. This can be countered by the outside view - collecting examples of similar activities from which a more measured estimate of averages and ranges can be determined. One can then compare the case under consideration against this set of examples, for example ``is the current team above or below average experience''? and adjust from the average accordingly. p 225-54 [I think this relates to other work on codification, case-base reasoning]

Optimism is valued and rewarded. Premortem is an option to reduce the effect of overconfidence p255-65

The Investors Assistance Program uses 37 criteria to test the likelihood of success of an idea p 257 Useful to overcome optimism bias - and to research optimism bias

Psychophysics is the study of how physical changes result in psychological changes - the latter tend to be logarhythmic p272

Bruno Frey: ``the agent of economic theory is rational, selfish and his tastes do not change'' p269

On observation, however, people do not maximise their expected values p 273

Bernoulli proposed ``expected utility'' which numerically values the psychological impact of a choise but it doesn't account for prior conditions p 276-7

Prospect Theory adds to utility theory by accounting for the additional psychology cost of loss (loss aversion) p 278-88

Prospect Theory does not include the cost of disappointment and regret p287-8 or the Endowment Effect by which use is valued more than exchange. People are more attached to what they have than what they could gain. p 289-99 [relates to stickiness?]

What seems to matter is the magnitude of change and whether it is a gain or a loss - leading the the ``fourfold pattern'':
* low power gain - risk seeking - e.g. lotteries
* low power loss - risk averse - e.g. insurance
* high power gain - risk averse - fits Bernoulli's work
* high power loss - risk taking - explains many bad outcomes when people are in dire straits and even businesses not cutting losses p 316-9 [sunk cost fallacy?]

We overweight rare events, especially if they are more vivid in our minds p 323-33 [c.f. Taleb2007's Black Swans, which are not vivid]

Implications of framing on policy and morality (``nudge'') [ethics] p 363-74

A broad personal risk policy is useful to avoid narrow framing and overweighting risk (e.g. when considering insurance - think about the cost and return across all insurance bought if stick with a specific policy regarding inclusions/exclusions and excess; e.g. max excess, don't buy enhanced cover) p 340-1

``you have no compelling moral intuitions to guide you ... your moral feelings are attached to frames, to descriptions of reality rather than reality itself'' [ethics] p 370

Our remembering self is not the same as our expeiencing self. Our memory of pain is relative to the peak and end of the painful experience not its duration. p 377-85

The U-index measures the proportion of waking hours spent on unpleasant activities and indicates how lives could be improved p 392-5

The experiences of welbeing are different to those of satisfaction p 397

Welbeing also relates to people's goals and their attainment p 402},

There's a general model of leadership in the 21st century, academic research in the field of leadership emphasizes:
* authentic leadership
* servant leadership
* adaptive leadership

Review what different authors have said abotu leadership looks in a VUCA world. Key aspects include (not limited to):
* VUCA focussed
* continuous imrprovement (including of leadership)
* resilience and flexibility
* healthy work environments
* collaboration
* mindfulness

Bringing together the 3 leadership architypes:
* authentic leaders: being true to oneself, being open for ambiguity, a penchant for accuracy, and the ability to recognize their own capabilities, demonstrate gentleness, modesty, and respect
* servant leaders: serving others first, being ethical, empathetic, action driven and demonstrating accountability, empowerment, and stewardship
* adaptive leaders: systematic thinking, especially when facing uncertainty, unpredictable information, and unknown circumstances 
* authentic and servant leadership: courageous to admit to their faults and mistakes, accept others' inaccuracy
* authentic and adaptive leadership: encourage debate and dialog conversation, for team feedback, for team retrospective, for conflict management
* servant and adaptive leadership: persuasive and influential among their coworkers, share their insights and are open to new ideas and foster new opinions
* authentic, servant, and adaptive leadership: problem solving skills, ability to maintain and be sensitive to relationships, empathy and motivation, or what can be called the PREM Model

The PREM model:
* Problem solving: Leaders ensure that they facilitate problem solving for their organizations
* Relationship: Leaders need to construct relationships with all stakeholders
* Empathy: Leaders need to treat their mental and physical well-being
* Motivation: Leaders need to sustain motivation via mentor and peer support programs and strengthen development-minded learning for continuous growth},

* manipulation: paradoxical prediction (legitimate courses of action are strictly limited and any form of appeal is condemned

  comment          = {Apply an evolutionary economics lens to the emergence and ecosystem of AI. This involves considering the actors (firms, industries and national settings) involved in AI, their roles, wider influences and path dependencies. Consider the work proposing that AI is a General Purpose Technology GPT and thus claiming that it should be supported by state funding. Main focus is machine learning.

Main findings:
- AI firms are heterogeneous, with evidence of a few firms that expand and grow in scope- AI is produced for the needs of tech firms but has been opened up partly to drive develop but also because those firms may benefit - state involvement is required less to drive develop but more to address power shift from state to firms
- particular sectoral and national patterns of innovation drive AI adoption and implementation
- ecosystems that connect developers and firms allow coordination, using modularisation, libraries and communities
- only a few firms are incentivised to use and produce AI and digital sophistication is a precondition for AI use
- expansion into other verticals is not as evident as the GPT discourse would indicate, except that where it is happening it is more about having access to data/information or creating ecosystems that lock-in customers
- domain expertise is an important complement to AI capabilities and like all technologies requires absorptive capacity
- AI is the result of a complex web of choices, mediated by regulatory (in)action
- there are many interdependencies across AI enablement, production and consumption which allow for continuous development of algorithms and reinforcement of power

``the seamless, digital connectedness enabled by AI-as-technology is, in our view, a unique feature that we have yet to fully grasp in terms of its economic, managerial, and even psychological implications''

Semi-structured interviews with 37 senior executives [I wonder how much they know about their firms' use of AI]

Define the technical architecture of ML in 5 parts (in 3 groups):
- acquire
  - source data
  - data integration
- organise and analyse
  - data science and ML tool
- deliver and operate
  -  model management system
  - application deployment

Use Boston Consulting Group's research which divides development of AI in 3 stages:
- enablement - mostly hardware and data processing = 2 layers/bricks
- production - algorithms, visualisation, frameworks
- consumption - use and diffusion

Considering the evolving dynamics of AI producers and enablers, they find that production and enablement stacks are mostly controlled by Big Tech: Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, Tencent. 

Find different operating modes:
- AI giants - as well as being enablers and producers, they are consumers in different parts of their businesses. They maintain their market position in every brick by develop, partnering with and acquiring leading companies
- AI-powered operators/applications - use AI in their day-to-day (e.g. Facebook, Uber) based both on services from AI giants and their own in-house capacity
- AI creators - produce primarily for specific 3rd-party use cases and largely rely on tech giants platforms and services
- AI traders/integrators - buy and sell AI solutions or use cases, adding value
- AI takers - require AI solutions to enable critical business functions

Evolutionary dynamics are driven by both economies of scale and scope:
- scale - enablement and production stacks have massive capital intensity and training models is costly 
- scope - actors with bigger datasets benefit and control large portion of the industry

Discuss the growth at the Edge and how this is allowing entry from new and diversifying players. 

Notes that possibly in response to concentration, the AI community is engaging more in platforms that share develop costs such as huggingface.com and rasa.com

The hyperscalers benefit from massive uptake of their upstream services, such as cloud, and they are incentivised to invest in these. Big Tech also publish more than academia. They ensure that their ecosystems are sturctured in a way that allows them to benefit from both their own data and that of their competitors.

Those firms making a success of AI have different operating model:
- driven by data
- their processes put AI at the core
- experiment and make decisions in real time
- learn proactively from the reaction of their customers
Thus they suggest that it is these areas that need investment (hyperscalers with all these bare not marginal cost in scaling AI)
This is consistent with evolutionary economics, ``Investments in technology per se do not drive performance; they must be complemented by investments in managerial and organizational capabilities that support the continuous transformation of ideas in products and services''

Compares China, US and EU and finds that the different commercial, academic, regulatory, political and cultural background have heavily influenced outcomes.

Considers the AI sector in terms of technological regimes and finds that success and innovation are a result of collaboration between small entrepreneurial firms causing disruption and large firms innovating.

The evolutionary economics approach is beneficial along 3 dimensions:
- phenomenological - map the nature of the system to guide policy and strategy
- epistemological - understand the dynamics of who produces AI to determine whether it will advance
- pragmatic - rethinking the role of AI as a GPT},

Suggest 3 questions for when deliberating over super wicked problems

Talk about applied forward reasoning
Distinct from scenario building

Durrant and Diehl conceptualised 4 types of policy development. Two keep the current equilibrium:
- faux paradigmatic - a significant change which only ends up being reversed e.g. by new government
- classic incremental - small oscillating changes which create limited impact or behavioural change
Two head towards a new equilibrium:
- classic paradigmatic - single-shot big change which is not reversed
- progressive incrementalism - stepped policy development which accumulates change over time towards significant results
Possible to misdiagnose these different types

Recognition that there are different ``levels'' or ``orders'' within a policy regime (e.g. broad goals to specific instruments)

There are 4 path-dependant processes that are useful for answering the diagnostic questions:
- lock-in
- self-reinforcing: costs over time
- increasing returns: benefits increase over time
- positive feedback: expanding populations and reinforcing original support

Applying these processes forward requires:
- consideration of non-linear and unfolding causal, yet unpredictable, policy trajectories
- attention to different policy levels or orders, the layering effects, not just pros and cons

Discuss the diagnostic questions further and provide guidance, considering:
- stickiness 
- coalitions
- values and norms},

Grand challenges:
- Complex - entailing many interactions and associations, emergent understandings and nonlinear dynamics
- Uncertain- confront organisations with radical uncertainty
- Evaluative (rubbish term) - no correct label, cutting across jurisdictional boundaries, implicating multiple criteria of worth and revealing new concerns even when they are being tackled

Suggest the American Philosophical school of pragmatism to solve grand challenges. 
Rooted in symbolic interactionism. Definition of problem is essential part of solution. This can be a distributed process [I think interactionist reasoning MercierS]. Also evolutionary learning process. 

Robust action emerges out of this. This preserves flexibility, until the time is right to consolidate. [maybe also no regrets]

Delve deeper into participatory architecture, a ``multivocality'' of artifacts that can be interacted with by multiple actors, distributed experimentation and innovation, novelty emerges 

``Given their complexities, uncertainties, and evaluativities, successfully addressing concerns such as climate change and other forms of environmental degradation requires the participation of scientists, local communities, consumers of resources, and other vested populations'' p374

Multiple actors are organisational, institutional and individual

  comment          = {Previously argued that policy analysis would make more progress by examining underlying dimensions such as scale, divisibility, monetisation. This paper examines the concept of wicked problems

Has 3 contentions with the high level use of the term wicked problems:
1. Most don't meet all criteria - conceptual stretching
2. Many rather ordinary policy problems have some attributes of wicked problems
3. The concept has taken a normative element that the problem must and can be solved through developing the appropriate policies 

Policymaking is actually more a continuous process of amelioration and adjustment. Promising to solve problems can weaken already diminished faith in government

In addition to the 10 criteria from RittelW1973, they add the general sense that wicked problems involve multiple actors and are socially and politically complex.

Also consider LevinCA2012's Super Wicked Problems and identify that time is a vital element of these, and increasingly so.

There is an absence of clear coding rules for the criteria

Profusion of wicked problems may be more down to the solutions (network policymaking)

Increased use of participation may be making finding solutions more difficult

Ostrom's polycentricity suggests there is capacity to find solutions using less centralised means

Suggest that considering complexity may be better for finding solutions than would wickedness

- has focused on specific and narrow fields 
- is dependent on tech giants digital technologies

Risks of dependence:
- limited technical autonomy 
- tech giants could be using data from Siemens' devices - in competition with them

- contracting different cloud providers
- strictly enforcing GDPR (doesn't prevent big tech learning from their device data

General comments about digital technologies being sold as black box technologies, which curtails reverse engineering and limits users' learning

Companies in EU are lagging in digital technologies.

Laggards should be able to leap-frog because they are not locked-in to older tech. However, global value chains means that adoption costs are outsourced and so leaders avoid the encumbant trap.

Just when we most need our government to work-to decarbonize our infrastructure and economy, to help the vulnerable through a pandemic, to defend ourselves against global threats-it is faltering. Government at all levels has limped into the digital age, offering online services that can feel even more cumbersome than the paperwork that preceded them and widening the gap between the policy outcomes we intend and what we get. But it's not more money or more tech we need. Government is hamstrung by a rigid, industrial-era culture, in which elites dictate policy from on high, disconnected from and too often disdainful of the details of implementation. Lofty goals morph unrecognizably as they cascade through a complex hierarchy. But there is an approach taking hold that keeps pace with today's world and reclaims government for the people it is supposed to serve. Jennifer Pahlka shows why we must stop trying to move the government we have today onto new technology and instead consider what it would mean to truly recode American government"-- Provided by publisher.},

A new practice needs to be:
- people-centred
- experimental
- data-enabled
- designed to scale

Hallmarks are:
- humility
- utility
- adaptability
- equality

People centred - tendency to see people as problem, it over simplify causes. Need to embed with user, experiment, obtain feedback. In government and community. Codify methodology to share with other areas. References Cottage and Bracken.

Scout and experiment - look for solutions rather than invent them. Scouts, such as social entrepreneurs, work alongside their subjects [my phrase since I can't find the statement]. Practitioners and researchers in a loop, share results across network of experimenters [anti-competitive], the new practise reports on solutions as they arise, broadcast, receive, refine and adapt continuously.

Data-enabled - measure, learn what works, make improvements when necessary. Data tighten the feedback loop between people receiving services and those steering them. Warns of risks of data - Eubanks.

Designed to scale - small is adaptable, responsive, etc but scale is needed to solve complex problems. Pilots need to become policy. Mulgan - pathways to scale:
- advocacy
- networks
- programmes
- franchising
- direct control

Not all public problems are suited to this new practise. Some are fights among contending political and economic interests in society.

Experiments are built on normative ideas

Benefits of experimentation:
- enables engagement and co-creation
- mitigates risk
- reaches beyond the obvious
- reveals what works
- steers operations in the desired direction

Ethical considerations - asks a series of questions for this

Experiments fail on continuum between
- exploratory (e.g. prototyping and raid cycle experiments)
- verification (e.g. RCTs, QEDs, nimble RCTs and A/B testing)

Experiments also fall in a continuum of ambition from incremental to transformative change

Therefore, 4 [I would argue: ideal-] types of experiment:
- transformative-exploratory - exploring new policy ideas
- transformative-verificatory - verifying effect of groundbreaking and strategically significant policies
- incremental-exploratory - exploring improvements
- incremental-verificatory - verifying the effects of small changes},

12, 11, 10 and 9 are mainly physical
8 upwards are largely informational
8 and 7 are feedback loops 
3 system goals
2 and 1 are paradigms

12. Constants, parameters, numbers - parameters are the point of least leverage, they rarely change behaviour, but most of the attention goes here

11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows - bigger buggers reduce instability but many buffers are physical are so difficult to increase

10. The structure of material stocks and flows and nodes of intersection - can make a huge difference such as new transport infrastructure but again often difficult to intervene because these are physical structures

9. The lengths of delays relative to the rate of system charges - when feedback, or the response to feedback, is delayed it's difficult to adjust the system appropriately, although it's usually easier to slow the change rate to match the feedback than the feedback rate

8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against - there may be many negative feedback loops, some inactive or invisible, beware of removing these emergency response mechanisms, e.g. in response to lobbying (which works due to a weakening of the democracy feedback loop)

7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops - reduce the tendency of the system to self-reinforce such as ``success to the successful''

6. The structure of information flows - making information more available and making consequences more direct for any action can encourage people and businesses to act on it

5. The rules of the system - challenge these!

4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organise system structure - grant this!

3. The goals of the system - more deduced from what the system does, e.g. growth, dominance, but also for instance articulated by a leader

2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises - e.g. the values, beliefs, aspirations of society

1. The power to transcend paradigms - no paradigm is ``true'', choose the one that suits},

Intervening in complex systems requires attention to both:
- avoid making systems worse with unintended negative consequences
- protect the mental sanity, motivation and emotional strength of those who aspire to change systems

Casual architecture:
- shaped by characteristics of people - beliefs, ambitions, skills, access to resources, norms, rules, etc
- generates characteristics and dynamics of social problems

Identify two archetypes for system change:
- changing the system by building the system - example of Sekem, community built from desert in Egypt to explore and demonstrate alternative agriculture, culture, education, lifestyle, etc
- changing the system by isolating a subsystem - example of Gram Vikas, subsystem in this case it's spatial, a village in India in which inequality was tackled first by building engagement (water and sanitation infrastructure) then addressing casual subsystem by insisting that all households were represented in decision-making, leading increased desirability of villages using this system, women would not be married into non transformed villages, result is positive feedback/reinforcement of transforms

Maintaining motivation in stakeholders requires organisations:
- do things right before doing the right thing (e.g. Gram Vikas found trying to directly tackle inequality wasn't effective, but installing sanitation guest was)
- climb system peaks to get a better view (e.g. Gram Vikas's early engagements provided a privileged position to understand the system more clearly)
- hire and nurture people with a commitment to learn (although discussion of this seems to not about organically building a team that is willing to learn, i.e. they stay the course)},

Actually two essays

Mulgan: ``Joined-Up innovation:   What iS SySteMiC innovation and hoW Can it be done effeCtiveLy?''

Uses the definition of system ``interconnected and interdependent patterns of action involving many institutions''
and systemic innovation ``an interconnected set of innovations, where each influences the other, with innovation both in the parts of the system and in the ways in which they interconnect''

Gives a potted history of systems design

Systemic change happens all the time, shaped by different actors but rarely quite to plan
Therefore can be very difficult, no one actor can control systemic innovation since there are usually many complementary innovations needed (roads, road markings, driving schools etc for cars)

System map to show what elements influence each other, causation plus state of knowledge. Some elements can be quantified

Knowing what kind of system you want to influence:
- number of factors that define it
- closed or open
- living or mechanical
- mature or immature technology
- capable of learning
- are there encumbants that are similar to innovation or is it an entirely new system?

Knowing the tools and capacities for change:
- richer in power than knowledge - emergent strategies
- richer in power and in knowledge - control strategies
- no created command of power or knowledge - distributed strategy
- richer in knowledge than power - collaborative strategies

Combine top-down and bottom-up (fuzzy or clumsy dynamics)

The rhythms if systems change may involve long periods with only a few pioneers than tipping point comes with a swarm of competing alternatives

Discussion of whether big organisations, who have ability to orchestrate change, are needed to innovate. Some relatively small organisations can be catalysts - although need mature existing stems to grow from.

Innovations need scrutiny, experimentation, to reduce risk of unforeseen, undesirable consequences - test on small scale before scaling

For achieving systems change:
- situate individual actions within the context of a broader movement of change and with a sense of a bigger picture
- articulate the direction of strategic change and link big ideas to individual innovations

Actions:
- move into existing peer structures
- research, advocacy, argument, policy promotion
- create new organisations that exemplify new system
- develop coalitions, networks
- develop new markets

Leadbeater: ``the SySteMS innovator:   Why SUCCeSSfUL innovation GoeS beyond prodUCtS ''

Apple, not first but launched as entry points into systems

Education started a private affairs but now a very stable, probably outdated (Victorian) system

The innovation of containerisation in detail

Twitter became a system when tweets became threads, videos could be included, APIs etc

Systems:
- create experiences that are repeatable, reliable, often standardised
- are codified, explicit and measurable (blind to context)

Systems often need infrastructure, which needs investment

Alliances are essential, often involving economics, governance and design

Systems can be tightly integrated or modular

Heathrow Terminal 5 was built on time and within budget as system is interconnecting systems - modular. Although once people started to use it, behaviour created chaos.

True systemic innovation involves behaviour change

System dimensions:
- heavy/light (e.g. traditional banks/internet banking)
- adapting/creating (e.g. switching energy sources in the developed/developing world)
- dominated/negotiated (oligopolies/many players)
- stable/fluid
- tight/loose (tightly coupled can be highly productive but can fail catastrophically)
- public/private (very few wholly private systems, gov at least provides standards, regularisation and standards)
- complicated/complex

Leading systems change strategies:
- drive
- repurpose 
- reconfigure
- leapfrog},

Three successive alignment models exhibit important shifts in technology strategy, competencies, and values of the organization. The three phases of incremental changes in shifting from one alignment model to the next are the emergence of new approaches, the embeddedness of these approaches in particular contexts, and their expansion to other organizational contexts.},
  comment          = {Argues that radical or step changes are often rejected by an organisation due to its ``organsational immune system'' [Weber's bureaucracy?]. Find that NASA has used incremental  approaches to adapt and evolve. [I'm drawn to think about an organisational version of Schwartz2017's strangler pattern].

Over 6 decades, NASA has had the strategic alignments:
- traditional hierarchical
- intergovernmental
- commercial network

caused by political, technological and financial influences. This paper studies what these looked like and how they were achieved. Argues that punctuated equilibrium models, by which change occurs through short period disruption, don't fit this case. Instead, transformational change occurs by incremental evolution - Quinn's Logical Incrementalism. Also argue that incrementalism may be an unappreciated driver of strategic agility.

Change emerges within strategically planned boundaries

In early forms, there was a long term "multigenerational" goals. Intervals between direction changes led directors to define strategy that would survive frequent changes.

Strategic alignment perspective requires alignment between:
- external environment
- strategy
- competencies
- organisation

Incremental steps involve processes of:
- emerging
- embedding
- expanding

Lindblom's muddling through is a precursor to incrementalism. 

Loads of detail on different phases and the transitions.

  - Augmentation for higher discretionary tasks
  - Tensions between cost and efficiency motives versus novel inputs to decision making and protecting citizens from algorithmic harm
  - Impact on the labour markets
- Nudging versus autonomy
  - Collective rights versus individual freedoms
  - State surveillance and behaviour control for achieving policy goals using AI
  - Citizen's right to object to being governed by AI
  - Personalised services and creation of filter bubbles
- Data accessibility versus security and privacy
  - Accessibility and use of existing citizen data collected for other purposes
  - Consent and providing data as a precondition for receiving public services
  - Constant threats to the security of sensitive data
- Predictive accuracy versus discrimination, biases, citizen rights
  - Use of sensitive variables for higher predictive power versus embedding biases and discrimination
  - Acceptable error rates against the risk of marginalisation of vulnerable communities
  - Digital divide
  - Negative learnings from the environment
  - Correlational knowledge versus contextual human knowledge
- Predictive accuracy versus transparency and accountability versus gaming the system
  - Higher predictive accuracy versus transparency and interpretation of results
  - Lacks casual intuition
  - Accountability and responsibility of AI decisions
  - Justification of AI based public decisions
  - Ability to game the system with higher transparency

Also data governance:
- Big,Open, and Linked Data (BOLD is dependent on multiple organisations or systems with different data management practices
- AI lacking contextual domain knowledge can exacerbate the data quality and validity issues
- Analogous management practices towards higher data quality and trustworthiness
- Increasing the data literacy of public administrators

There are other lists of themes around:
- AI diffusion outcomes (considers public values and public administration transformation)
- AI implementation strategies (considers experimentation, innovative procurement, collaboration and co-creation, project management)

The water is the water in which fish swim - from their perspective it probably isn't even there

Systems change is shifting the conditions that are holding a social or environmental problem in place

There are 6 conditions of systems change - and inverted pyramid, in three levels:
- Structural change (explicit)
  - policies
  - practices
  - resource does
- (semi-explicit)
  - relationships and connections
  - power dynamics
- Transformative change (implicit)
  - mental models (this poses the greatest challenge and also applies to those trying to create change)

E.g. Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) created huge impact on the first level but hasn't had much influence in the second level and hasn't changed mental models therefore not influenced the third level.

Tools help. A tool for mapping power that led to me nutritious meals in schools

Narratives are shaped by, and shape, mental models

Examples of swapping leaders for leaders from affected community, putting youth into deciding making board.
Community centred 

Two types of power dynamics veneer l between foundations and grantees:
- power-over - stress importance of proven track record, high organisational capacity, clear theory of change, ability to produce outcomes
- power-with - stress importance of participative approach, connection to the grassroots and innovative approaches, out off by a theory of change},

Could be useful to further studies of innovation or AI adoption

Mainstream literature has only nature focus on data, processing power and algorithm development

De Vries et al 2016 developed a framework based on work of Borins 2000 and Rogers 2010.

SchedlerGF2019 identified that barriers to adoption of innovation across government remain the same, and this paper therefore considered these antecedent conditions with respect to AI:
- environmental antecedents - other organisations, institutions, network, public opinion, media, political,
- organizational antecedents - structure, culture, finance, knowledge, support, days interoperability 
- invitation-related antecedents - perception of value, ease of use
- individual-related antecedents - leadership (but necessarily senior)

Consider 3 case studies:
- SATIKAS - Estonia, grassland mowing using satellite data and CNN
- Predictuve day-care services inspection - Belgium, logistic regression and XGBoost on data from internal ``warehouse'' using insights from inspectors to make them more  accurate [smacks of stories in Eubanks]
- AmberScript - Netherlands, automatic transcription for video council meetings in partnership with WebCast fine tuned with council transcripts

Also semi structured interviews

For each, identifies nature of antecedent conditions that are drivers or barriers to adoption, broken down to sub-conditions:
- Environmental
  - local pressure
  - networks
  - private vendors
  - isomorphism
  - regulation
- Organisational
  - organisational resources
  - IT resources
  - end-user participation
  - training
  - management support
  - organisational culture
  - incentives
- Innovation
  - perceived value
  - compatibility with organisational values
  - ease of use
  - security and privacy concerns
- AI antecedents:
  - high-quality data
  - maintenance of data
  - data sharing
  - data-driven services ecosystem
- Individual
  - an individual who drive the innovation 

Also 
- data governance
- data sharing
- datafication of societal processes including metadata codification, semantic interoperability efforts
- technical infrastructure
- social, economic, political and ethical challenges after adoption
- black box versus accountability

Interviews have ``risk of bias that the managers see the innovation as a great success...might not be shared by other actors''

Useful to identifying drivers and outcomes of innovation and for hints on better structuring of studies of public sector innovation (they are quite critical of existing studies)

Studies are analysed based on themes:
1. the definitions of innovation
2. innovation types
3. goals of innovation
4. antecedents of innovation
5. outcomes of innovation

Develop a framework of potentially important antecedents and effects of public sector innovation

Propose 3 future research suggestions:
1. more variety in methods: moving from a qualitative dominance to using other methods, such as surveys, experiments and multi-method approaches
2. emphasize theory development and testing as studies are often theory-poor
3. conduct more cross-national and cross-sectoral studies, linking for instance different governance and state traditions to the development and effects of public sector innovation

Types of innovation:
- Process innovation (vast majority)
  - Administrative process innovation
  - Technological process innovation
- Product or service innovation
- Governance innovation
- Conceptual innovation
- Other

Innovation goals:
- Increasing effectiveness (majority of goal mentioned)
- Increasing efficiency
- Tackling societal problems (e.g. addressing unemployment, overweight) 
- Increasing customer satisfaction
- Involving citizens
- Involving private partners
- Other
- No goals mentioned (vast majority)

Environmental antecedents:
- Environmental pressures (media attention, political demands, public demands) (majority)
- Participation in networks and inter-organizational relationships
- Regulatory aspects
- Compatible agencies/organizations/states adopting the same innovation
- Competition with other organizations
-  Other

Organizational antecedents:
- Slack resources (time, money, ICT facilities) (majority)
- Leadership styles
- Degree of risk aversion/room for learning
- Incentives/rewards
- Conflicts
- Organizational structures
- Other

 Innovation characteristics:
- Ease in use of innovation 
- Relative advantage
- Compatibility
- Trialability
- Other (e.g. cost, trustworthiness, mouldability) (majority)

Individual antecedents:
- Employee autonomy (empowerment) (majority)
- Organizational position (tenure, mobility)
- Job-related knowledge and skills (professionalism)
- Creativity (risk-taking, solving of problems) Demographic aspects (age, gender)
- Commitment/satisfaction with job
- Shared perspective and norms
- Innovation acceptance
- Other

Outcomes of public sector innovation:
- Effectiveness
  - Increased effectiveness (majority of outcomes given)
  - Decreased effectiveness
- Increased efficiency
- Private partners involved
- Citizens involved
- Increased customer satisfaction
- Other (safety, fairness etc.)
- No outcomes mentioned (vast majority)

Observe:
1. organizational antecedents play the largest role in enabling all innovation types
2. governance innovations are frequently connected to environmental antecedents, including the resources of private partners

In the reviews, they find:
1. a lack of a clear theoretical underpinning in the studies reviewed:
  1a. only a few studies referred to existing theories such as those of Rogers (2003) on the diffusion of innovations and of Damanpour (1991) on innovations within organizations
  1b. the empirical research to date has been largely unsuccessful in identifying and explaining what occurs after innovations are initiated
2. The `publicness' of public innovations was not clear (suggest referring to (Bozeman and Bretschneider 1994)
3.  antecedents were often addressed independently, ignoring possible connections between them},

Nice statistics on benefits to firms/teams of hiring different discriminated against groups

Educated and connected managers more important than experienced managers [relates to ZolloW2002 and BlettnerKL2023]

Findings:
1. Firms were unable to adequately replace the characteristics of dismissed managers (important connectors to other
firms, managerial experience, university-educated)
2. The market valuation, profitability, and efficiency of affected firms fell. ``A back-of-the-envelope calculation implies that removing the Jewish managers caused large reductions in the aggregate market valuation of German listed firms'' [define large]
3 . The effects persisted until at least ten years after managers started leaving their firms
4. Highlight particular managerial characteristics that are hard to replace (managers with connections and university
education, especially with graduate degrees in social sciences, had large effects on firm performance, losing experienced managers was less harmful)

Analogues in Idi Amin/Uganda's ejection of Asians, ethnic Chinese in Indonesia and Huguenots

As well as lots due to dismissal, evidence that less drastic discrimination can lead to lots of talent, now a number of recent analogues such as US ban on citizens from 7 Muslim- majority countries, Persecution of Turkish businessmen, Brexit},

Propose policy framework to lay bare disagreements:
- introduction
- analytic framework
  - scope
  - model
  - estimation
  - standing
  - criteria
  - weights
- results
- sensitivity analysis
- conclusions and recommendations

For each topic in the analytic framework, identify what are the sources of disagreement [not unlike Lindblom1959 suggesting that only the different marginal combinations of values need considering]

Archetype analysts:
- dispassionate analyst, driven by facts and models
- advocate-analyst, predominantly driven by values

Makes loads of statements about these archetypes without any recourse to evidence

Domains of disagreement:
- positive, relates to how world is understood to work, includes:
  - scope (portion of world trying to understand)
  - model (explanatory mechanisms and behaviours)
  - estimate (of model parameters that are thought to obtain particular context)
- values, e.g. ideology, public opinion, party loyalty, includes:
  - standing (who counts)
  - criteria (what counts)
  - weights (how much they count)

Also separate values into:
- operational - can be challenged in positive grounds, e.g. behavioural economics
- provisional - friend in falls in positive understanding

Stealth issue advocacy - when analyst's values are secreted into purportedly positive analysis

Aggravation by invoking historical analogies

Leave aside:
- entrenched disagreement
- strategic disagreement

Considers these areas of disagreement with respect to climate policy. [Difficult to read in 2023 when many arguments are/should be dead and buried]

On models: ``although we withhold or views as to whether realistic assumptions are essential ... conclude that accurate prediction is most important''

When models can lead to one result and it's opposite, suggest ``turn to empirical analysis'' [as if this is otherwise optimal] Refers to this as the scientific method

Recognises that it becomes in the interests of some actors to underinvest in evidence 

Economic models for climate outcomes must account for behavioural responses and yet not become unwieldy

``as evidenced by the 2008 financial meltdown, economics is much better at explaining the last than predicting the future''

``our premise is that it is helpful to uncover the true sources of disagreement, but this does not mean that every values disagreement should be driven, on the one side, into the positive domain, or on the other, ever deeper into the values domain. Not every disagreement must be resolved by science and statistics on the one hand, or by the likes of Aristotle and Immanuel Kant on the other. The policy world would grind to a halt if we demanded such rigorous classification and clarification of every disagreement''},

Second, based on descriptive analysis, correspondence analysis and multivariate probit models, we explore factors explaining the perception of obstacles, and study complementarities between those obstacles.

Insights from their review is of systems and transformation literature:
- Theory insights:
  - attention to a system's boundary and the processes used to define it can improve the efficacy of systems change endeavours
  - a change in a system level outcome is not the same as, nor does it guarantee, system change
- methods insights:

    - systems dynamic modelling - systems have reinforcing and balancing feedback loops
    - soft systems methodology - more about the social construction of reality, multiple valid perspectives
- systems change efforts insights:
  - levers targeted for change need to have cross level influences within the targeted system

Despite their benefits, the adoption of many cloud services is still limited, and many organizations are hesitant to adopt cloud technologies for several reasons. Researchers have used innovation adoption theories to explore the factors influencing users' decisions toward accepting and using a new information system. This study presents a systematic review of the factors influencing organizational decisions concerning the acceptance of cloud-based technologies using the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework. We analyze, integrate, and classify these factors and show that much of the literature has emphasized the technical aspects of technology adoption, such as cloud security. We further show factors like top management support, relative advantage, cloud complexity, and competitive pressure are the most critical factors affecting organizational attitude toward cloud technology adoption.},

Critical concerns:
1. selecting the appropriate technology adoption theory remains a critical task for researchers in information systems adoption
2. the majority of the literature neglected the investigation of the impact of culture on cloud adoption (e.g. this may explain why studies in different cultures (KSA v Spain) report contrasting findings about the importance of different factors
3.  cloud computing adoption in the educational sector has received little attention
4. the literature lacks studies that focus on how different factors may have different impacts on cloud adoption over time
5. there is evidence that non-technical factors in cloud computing adoption are crucial and have started to gain more attention},

While there is a plethora of research on its causes and consequences, a growing body of research on mitigating work-related technostress is emerging. In order to identify opportunities to overcome this &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; of technology, this scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on how to prevent and cope with work-related technostress. The databases PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, PSYNDEX, and Web of Science were searched in the time period between 2008 and 2021. The studies were screened independently by two authors and selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sixty-two studies were included and their methodological quality was assessed using standardised checklists. Resources were identified at the technical, organisational, social and personal level, including, e.g., leadership, organisational and technical support as well as self-efficacy and IT mindfulness. Problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies were, e.g., seeking support or distancing from IT. None of the included studies investigated prevention measures, emphasising a dearth of research that needs to be addressed in the future. Nevertheless, the identified resources and coping strategies provide starting points to address adverse work- and health-related consequences and reduce work-related technostress.},

Technostress is widely understood as the ``inability to adapt or cope with new computer technologies in a healthy manner''. It has creators:
- techno-overload - the technology-related demand to work longer and faster
- techno-invasion - constant connectivity and, consequently, a diffusion of work into private life
- techno-complexity - an individual's difficulty to understand certain tasks or conditions
- techno-insecurity - can be triggered, e.g., when employees feel threatened with losing their jobs due to their perceived insufficient understanding of technologies or as a consequence of automation
- techno-uncertainty - stressful situations with ambiguous expectations or outcomes


growing research on work-related technostress outside Covid pandemic context has already elaborated the causes and effects of technostress on an extensive scale

far less research has investigated how to address these causes or deal with adverse effects resulting from technostress

none addressed prevention measures

Results section breaks down in detail these topic areas:
- job demands and person-related risk factors
  - organisational level
  - technical level
  - person-related risk factors
- environmental and person resources
  - environmental resources social level
  - environmental resources organisational level
  - environmental resources technical level
  - personal resources
- appraisal - the process that decides whether potential stressors are actually perceived as threatening or not
- coping strategies
  - problem-focused
  - emotion-focused
- preventing work-related technostress},

- social cognitive theory - relationship of individual to current and future environment
- lazy user theory - choose solution that requires least effort

Discovered 5 themes of strategies used in public sector organisations to utilize cloud computing (see thesis for details):
- user-centric and data-driven cloud - top-down approach to requirements, bottom-up is data driven [I think]
- multi-cloud - using a range of selection methods
- visibility - data, analysis, logging, particularly for security

``This contrasts with some other chipmakers' practices. Intel, for example, has for many years followed an approach called Copy EXACTLY!, under which each new fab must operate under the exact parameters transferred from the company's technology development centre in Oregon''

``TSMC's approach relies to a large extent on having the R\&D team, which develops new process technology, only an hour-long high-speed rail ride away. With 20 hours of flight time between Arizona and headquarters, new procedures are needed''

Suggests alternative definitions and notation. ``The crux of the problem with causal-loop diagrams ... is that they make no distinction between information links and rate-to-level links (sometimes called ``conserved flows'')''. This is not a problem with equations or stock-and-flow diagrams. This paper discusses how to overcome the ambiguity of these types of link. ``In recognition of these difficulties, there has been a revival of stock-and-flow diagrams as a means of communicating structure (Morecroft 1982)'' Causal loops have traditionally been represented with a plus sign to indicate that a change in the variable at the start of the arrow will result in the change in the same direction of the variable at the end of the arrow. A minus sign means the second variable will change in the opposite direction. However, rate variables such as birth or migration can decrease but the outcome is still an increase (e.g. in population), albeit it slower. These are ``rate-to-level'' (``conserved flow'', ``additive'') connections (links), not information (``proportional'') connections (links). Suggest alternative definitions, the preferred being: ``A has a positive (negative) influence on B if A adds to (subtracts from) B, or if a change in A results in a change in B in the same (opposite) direction''. Also suggest using solid lines for rate-to-level connections and dotted lines for information connections. Others have used straight and curved lines, or valves and tubs to distinguish. Go on to demonstrate how it can be difficult to determine whether some such links are positive or negative (their polarity): - if the rate reduces, the outcome could still increase or it could decrease, and this may change over time - there may be hidden minor loops which affect behaviour over time - the causal loop may be a net rate which aggregates rates in both directions Advises resisting giving causal loops polarities. Gives an example of a feuding family in which an increase in one family results in a decrease in the other family, which increases the first family further. Conversely a decrease in the first family, would result in few deaths in the second, which results in more killed, and thus a further decrease, in the first.},

  comment          = {tl;dr: Argues that small systems dynamics models can aid policymaking and help policymakers learn about the environment and dynamics of a system. 
Identifies 5 characteristics of public policy problems. Discusses two examples of small systems models to demonstrate how 4 core aspects of these small models address the 5 characteristics of public policy problems. Lists some limitations of small models.

Use literature review to demonstrate how there was very little application of systems dynamics in government policymaking

State 5 characteristics of public policy problems:
1. Policy resistance from the environment - may be balancing feedback from the system or resistance from actors, can undermine policy even exacerbate original problem (compensating feedback)
2. The need for and cost of experimentation - policies are high stakes and aren't reversible, experiential learning and adjustments are vital but policy resistance and delay create even more complexity
3. The need to achieve consensus between diverse stakeholders - failing this can lead to short-term focus which ignores or even damages longer-term outcomes
4. Overconfidence in policymakers - evidence from observation and psychology experiments, delays in feedback make learning more difficult
5. The need to have an endogenous perspective -  undesirable outcomes tend to be blamed on external factors rather than factors within the system, endogenous perspective improve individual and organisational learning

Review two small models to demonstrate how they can be used to successfully make critical public policy insights:
1. Urban dynamics - URBAN1 is the small model for investigating the causes of urban decay. The stocks are population, housing, and business structures. Original model had at least 9 major stock variables. All these stocks grow until land scarcity starts to slow growth, particularly of businesses, leading (ultimately - more detail in paper) to a higher population than can be supported by the available jobs. Not only does this model provide insights into causes of urban decay but it also supports the design of policy by demonstrating the feedback structure of the system. Shows results of different interventions such as increasing the number of jobs, which can have unintuitive outcomes.
2. Swamping insight model - a small system dynamics model was created that examines the effect of investment in the different parts of a new system of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) in particular the probability of recidivism. Stocks are Families on TANF and Post TANF employed. Found that increasing the capacity of support after TANF has a positive effect, while increasing the capacity of TANF support increases the number of families at risk (because this leads to overcapacity - swamping of -  post TANF support).

[The models as illustrated in this paper distinguish stocks and flows, reinforcing and balancing loops and information links very clearly (it seems the problems stated in Richardson1986 are overcome here)]

For each of the five characteristics of public policy problems, this paper tabulates how small systems dynamics models can benefit, with respect to:
- feedback loop approach to modelling - feedbacks modelled in the small systems models, and turning these off can demonstrate some of the false assumptions of decision makers. Their inclusion therefore emphasises endogenous sources of behaviour
- aggregate approach to modelling, which groups individuals and even groups, and uses stocks and flows in the model structure
- simulation approach - running mathematical simulations to conduct experiments given different conditions
- small model size - only a few stocks and are most 7 or 8 feedback loops:
  1. a small model size allows for exhaustive experimentation through parameter changes
  2. short exposition facilitates the presentation of lessons to others, and helps bring the dynamic lessons to the meetings of stakeholders

Limitations of small models:
1.  customers in general and policymakers in particular often demand an exclusive model that considers all possible causal links either observed or contemplated
2. stakeholders may want to see their own organisations, departments, or communities separately represented, increasing the level of disaggregation
3. modellers may underestimate the role of some feedback loops which may actually be important in reality
4. the process of building small models may in fact be more difficult than building larger models that include multiple feedback loops
5. care is needed to ensure that causal links in are operational at high level

Also:
Mention near start about building consensus around small models

Key insights of Urban Dynamics:
1. the total attractiveness of an urban region must be considered relative to the attractiveness of all surrounding regions (Forrester, 1971b) - this preserved in the small version
2. the decay phase comes from natural asymmetries in the structure and dynamics of business structures and housing - reasonably easy to see in URBAN1 and almost impossible to draw out of the full Urban Dynamics model

Create consensus
- Better view of whole system - narrative and feedback
- Better understanding of endogenous behaviour
- Allows exhaustive experimentation},

Lists lots of benefits of cloud for gov

Potential risks / obstacles impeding adoption (Burton 2015; ENISA2015):
- standards
- certification
- data protection
- interoperability
- lock-in
- legal certainty

Increasing pressure to measure IT value but little with actually doing this

Use Anthony 1965 for progressive hierarchical lens for napping rewards and risks of cloud.

Rewards:
- strategic
  - centralisation of infrastructure
  - increased resilience
  - device and location independence
  - release internal IT resources
  - better citizen services
  - green technology
- tactical
  - improved business continuity and disaster recovery
  - improved agility and empowerment
  - faster implementation
  - improved security
  - scalability
  - easier application migration
- operational
  - reduced costs
  - reduced maintenance and support
  - flexibility of work practices
  - utilisation and efficiency improvements
  - shared services
  - increased peak load capacity

Risks:
- strategic
  - unproven financial business case
  - loss of governance
  - lack of trust in providers
  - security and privacy issues
- tactical
  - portability restrictions
  - lack of data ownership
  - integration restrictions
- operational
  - poor performance
  - limited storage capacity
  - financial pressures
  - loss of control
  - lack of detailed information about data locations
  - disaster recovery restrictions
  - lack of service availability
  - difficult to customise

Look at 3 case studies of local authorities. They had Gartner IT maturity factors of 5, 3 and 4 out of 5. Used various materials (meeting minutes, interviews, informal discussion, diaries, emails). Interviews were all with managers and heads. Considered:
1. IT strategy
2. Motivation for implementing cloud technology
3. Strategy used for evaluating the user of cloud
4. Cost benefits realised by exploiting cloud

Nice details on research methods. 

Tables show how each case study experienced each reward and risk. E.g. they all found ``difficult to customise'' a significant risk. Also discuss each factor individually. With returning to this for specific factors of interest.

String project management across all cases but not appropriate training
Current position is organisations is optimistic because there is further opportunity to develop

``although there were mixed outcomes with the implementation of cloud computing across all the cases, the deployment of this technology has been well received by employees and users''

Lesson 1 - Public sector organisations need to critically question the underlying assumptions of their existing IT infrastructures and
assess strategically whether a cloud solution fits the risks
and rewards considered to be acceptable by the organisation and its stakeholder community

Lesson 2 - Cloud implementation should have an explicit concern for the organisational context and flexible working methods that need to be adopted if the full benefits of cloud computing are to be leveraged in the public sector

Lesson 3 - The views and assumptions of cloud should be exposed and considered within the public authorities' evaluation process and not be ephemeral to it

Lesson 4 - The hierarchical and political nature of public sector organisations creates a barrier to change and this must be overcome to ensure cloud solutions are successful in practice

Lesson 5 - Public sector organisations must ensure the cloud solution is secure to ensure data is not accessed by unauthorised parties

Lesson 6 - Public sector organisations should undertake a cloud benefits review to ensure the solution is a clear business case
that is delivering cost savings, business efficiency savings and value for money

Lesson 7 - Public authorities should ensure that the strong leadership of the national government is followed to enable dynamic cloud solutions to be deployed to shape public sector outcomes

Lesson 8 Public sector organisations should promote cloud internally and ensure adequate training is undertaken

Lesson 9 - Public authorities should implement adequate, legal, regulatory and governance frameworks to ensure cloud systems functions successfully

Lesson 10 - Public sector organisations should create a cloud aware culture to capitalise on the impact and benefits

Discuss waves of innovation in public services. The first, in neoliberal 80s was  New Public Management (NPM) and a second wave is technologically centred approach that Dunleavy referred to as digital-era governance (DEG). Argues for a Public Values Management (PVM) perspective in exploring AI adoption in government.

Nice overviews of NPM, DEG and PVM

4 main critiques of NPM from (Hood 1991):
1. strong institutional character was resistant change from NPM
2. NPM was less based on evidence and more on political motivations and hasn't delivered its promises
3. NPM assumes superiority of market control and performance management goals cause focus on short-term institutional goals rather than broader vision of public service
4.  NPM claimed universality but different administrative values resulted in varied resulting cultures

Whilst first wave of IT reform was driven by NPM but it treated it entirely as a tool and thus failed to account for the transformation this would have on government

DEG locates human-machine interactions at the core of government service delivery, with 3 themes (from Dunleavy 2006):
1. reintegration - consolidating agencies that were disaggregated by NPM, e.g. with shared services
2. needs-based holism - re-engineering services, citizen engagement, agile government etc.
3. digitalisation change - global trend towards open government and transparency

``Chris and Susan'' (Muellerleile and Robertson 2018)  find that DEG represents an institutional framework, representing Weber's techno-scientific logic through rule-based rationality:
- humans
- algorithms
- data collection devices
- surveillance

Three core values of public administration are (from Hood1991), which constitute the strategic triangle (popularised by Moore 1995) and widened by Bannister and Connolly 2014 (after /):
- sigma - relates to economy and parsimony / duty (also non-financial)
- theta - relates to honest and fairness / service (responsibility to provide a good service to customers)
- lambda - relates to security and resilience / social (also quasi-political view of social values)
NPM is only sigma (cost cutting, efficiency and performance management)

``With strategy derived from public values, the operational capacity building turns towards long-term outcomes, public managers shift from results orientation to stakeholder interactions and co-production with citizens (Bryhinets et al., 2020; Karkin et al., 2018; Panagiotopoulos et al., 2019)''

``PVM provides an appropriate democratic process for resolving ethical dilemmas with the implementation of AI in the public sector (Andrews, 2018; Panagiotopoulos et al., 2019)''

Review of technology adoption models. Focuses on models arising from UTAUT from Venkatesh et al 2003, UTAUT2 and meta-UTAUT (Dwivedi et al 2020) which overlaps VenkateshB2008's TAM3. In discussion it briefly mentions Sohn and Kwon's 2020 finding that  consumer acceptance of AI base products fitted the Value-based Adoption Model (VAM; KimCG2007) better than UTAUT. Worth looking into these.

Also looks at reviews of AI in government, citing work (Misuraca et al 2020, Reis et al 2019) that find that public sector AI is not very orientated towards public values.

``there is a concern that lack of public administration scholarship and consideration of public values will once again create conditions whereby the government adopts private sector models with disappointing results similar to NPM-era IT projects''

Performed review of case studies to:
- develop a typology
- enumerate the factors that impact citizen adoption


Four themes are identified:
- compliance
- organisational management
- public service delivery (highest percentage)
- regulatory functions (e.g. research and policy development) 
Also labelled each use case with the public values orientation (duty, etc.) and AI Principles (Floridi and Cowls 2019)

Discusses different aspects of value, their prominence and whether they are internal or external in orientation. Makes a series of propositions, which are largely reflective of the citizen adoption goal [therefore less of interest to me right now].},

Interventions are considered non-linear and aim to catalyse emergent change

This paper argues the the increased uptake of concepts of compleity and systems thinking in peacebuilding is not addressing inequalities between intervenors and those ``targetted'' by interventions

Accountability to ``taxpayer'' is directing attention from accountability to those targetted and (re)produces a clear hierarchy

There is an exceptionalism in peacebuilding that it is too non-linear to use normal interventions or measures, therefore applying complexity theory and systems thinking. This exceptionalism disqualifies the collection of evidence of what works.

Also emphasis on creating learning culture, which this paper argues is show in the literature to be in opposition to a accoundability culture.

Demonstrates how this is particularly so in peacebuilding compare to other interventions such as humanitarian aid

- critical awareness - assumptions and conditions that give rise to them
- improvement - defined temporaily and locally, with awareness of power
- methodological pluralism - awareness of strengths and weakness of approaches

Discusses development of ideas on the process of making critical boundary judgements:
- Churchman - introduced idea that boundaries determine how improvement will be defined and that sweeping in new stakeholders extends boundaries and makes solutions more inclusive
- Ulrich - rationality needed in justifying boundaries, requires dialogue
- Midgley - idea that consensus on boundaries needs challenging by bringing in new stakeholders and recognition that marginalisation arises from judgements of what is sacred (valued) and profane (devalued)
- Midgley and Milne devised `rolling out' the boundaries by asking interviewees who should also be interviewed [is this like snowballing?]

Ulrich also 12 questions that could be used by a party to challenge an implementation that they disagree with [I should look these up]

The description of how this was applied in a real example includes the researchers recognition that sacred-profane judgements could occur as a result of one set of stakeholders needing to hold a meeting without others in the room (team handled this by assigning roles that advocated for non-present stakeholders), or their own expertise (knowledge and language), which they addressed by presenting critiques of their knowledge and carefully using plain english to describe their work.

Supported participants to design their solution by setting a scenario that existing situation has been swept away and that they could design their ideal solutions, with the limitations that this is:
- technologically feasible
- viable
- adaptable

Mentions Habermas's theory that a rational view is gained by dialog [which also aligns with Ostrom and MercierS2017]

Also mentions Ulrich2005's Critical System Heuristics 12 questions `` build an argument with which to embarrass planners in future public debate by
exposing the limited nature of the expertise they lay claiim to''

  comment          = {Deciding on policy has two approaches [at the time of this paper, maybe still now?]:
* Rational-comprehensive (root) - firstly agree objectives, values and constraints and identify the policy from all possible policies that best achieves this [think: utility maximisation] - this is a approach that was described in literatures on decision-making despite not being used in practice
* Successive limited comparisons (branch) - selection of value goals and analysis of needed action are not distinct and test of good policy is agreement on that policy

Characterises and formalises the second

Theory is the resort of the root approach - a  ``scientific'' method. ``Comparative analysis, as in the branch method, is sometimes a systematic alternative to theory''

The root method looks inferior in practice between it excludes some policy alternatives, when the theory says it should not, whereas the branch method deliberately, systemmatically and definsibly excludes alternatives

People can agree on policy if not criteria for deciding on propositions

The root approach breaks down in its handling of values:
- complex social problems are beset with disagreements about values
- even if there is agreement on values, they may be partially conflicting and even individuals may not be able to decide on their relative importance
- values are relative to circumstance

However, the only values that matter in the decision-making are those whose outcome differs between policies, and then it is the different marginal combinations of values that need considering [not dissimilar to RobertZ2011's argument for focussing on the disagreements between different architypal policymakers]

``the only practicable way to disclose one's relevant marginal values even to oneself is to describe the policy one chooses to achieve them''

Argues that different agencies oversight achieves a degree of comprehensiveness: ``Almost every interest has its watchdog'' - mutual adjustment [does not fully recognise the extreme differences in power that these watchdogs may have]

``Policy is not made once and for all; it is made and re-made endlessly. Policy-making is a process of successive approximation to some desired objectives in which what is desired itself continues to change under reconsideration'' - succession of comparisons

The idea of ``muddling through'' is not very muddled. It is looking back at what has been done and what we know works. Its not very innovative.

Caveats:
1. aspects of strategically aligned policy may still be disputed
2. alignment is usually constructed not discovered
3. alignment is unstable (iteration is valueable here)

Misalignment typically occurs when two characteristics are aligned but one is not. It can be difficult to diagnose and policy designers and analysts have motive to persuade themselves that alignment exists.

Overall ``public policy has yet to exploit the full potential of ST and its full range of methods''

Also find:
- there is a lack of rigorous investigation of the perspectives of civil servants and policy-makers on the usefulness of ST concepts and tools for policy analysis and stakeholder engagement
- there is no assessment of their learning and development related to adopting ST and their commitment to findings
- unsuccessful cases of adopting ST in policy are likely to be underreported, and people who do not buy into the approach are likely not to participate in relevant ST activities and interviews

Claimed Benefits and Values of ST in Policy:
- Understand the Complexity of Systems and Wicked Problems
- Capture Multiple Perspectives and Provide a Holistic View
- Facilitate Stakeholder Participation and Collaboration
- Shift Thinking and Mental Models
- Act as a Learning and Decision-Making Support Tool
- Achieve a Shared, Collective Understanding and Enhance Problem-Ownership, Consensus, and Commitment
-  Impact Policy and Practice
- Useful in Dealing with a Lack of Data

Challenges of Implementing ST in Practice (see paper for details and specific recommendations):
- Conceptualisation, language, and communication
  - Intrinsic reluctance to new ways of thinking
  - Unfamiliarity with and misconception about ST concepts, tools, and values
  - Confusing concepts and terminology
  - Cross-discipline miscommunication
  - Lack of recognition of the relevance of ST and policy-making
- Competence, methodology, and practice
  - Lack of competence in applying ST
  - Lack of technical and practical support and guidance
  - Uncertainty about the suitability and effectiveness of certain ST tools
  - Difficulty in generalising lessons from case studies
  - Lack of confidence in the intrinsic validity of ST
- Stakeholder engagement
  - Varied quality in participation among diverse stakeholders and over time
  - Fear of disruption to work routines
  - Difficulty in managing stakeholder equality in participation and power dynamics
  - Under-representation of specific stakeholder groups
  - Lack of trust between stakeholders
- Time and resources
  - Lack of time and resources for engaging stakeholders and applying ST
  - Lack of time and budget for evaluating the effectiveness of ST
- Political, structural, and operational aspects
  - Challenging political contexts
  - Organisational inertia and rigidity
  - Departmentalism
  - Lack of organisational incentive to implement ST
- Evaluation and evidence of impact
  - Lack of guidance and expertise for evaluation
  - Lack of funding for evaluation
  - Lack of concrete evidence for policy impact
  - Reluctance to scrutinise the work
  - Subjectivity in evaluation

Recommendations:
- Clarify ST Concepts and Values in Policy Contexts and Invest in Communication
- Build Capacity
- Engage Stakeholders and Maintain their Engagement
- Expand Funding
- Consider Political Endorsement and Governmental Reform and Enhance Policy Leaders' Buy-In and Support
- Develop Evaluation Strategies},

Actors have either or both of
- substantive interest
- official standing

Political arenas have rules: p278
- legislatures have rules of order
- agencies have administrative procedures
- also unwritten traditions and standard practices

found several advantages:
- increments helped produce regular outputs
- able to adapt to changes in our collaborators circumstances
- able to run two projects in a time period that would not have been possible with a more traditional research approach

practical lessons:
- need committed stakeholders as the work involves observing challenging situations, which is not always comfortable for stakeholders
- need to set up a secondary contact for when primary contact is unavailable e.g. on holiday
- time-boxes should be measured in elapsed time rather than calendar time due to different working patterns of team members
- iterative data analysis approach is effective for the investigation stage but needs to be different during evaluation (not yet completed an evaluation stage)
- need more time to prepare outputs maybe adding an extra stage for this purpose},

Past reforms failed to acknowledge the pressures, constraints and motivating associated with policy making, thus fall into traps:
- setting out an idealised process that is too distant from reality
- offering realistic ambitions but not specifying how they will be achieved
- reorganising structures to improve policy making without embedding them in a wider view of what good policy making looks like
- neglecting the role of politics

``Policy makers must reflect the flexible, perhaps chaotic, nature of public decision making, rather than cling to a false ideal of rationality''

Yet, they should strive for more resilient policy process because:
- complaints about current policy making focus on its ad hoc and rushed nature
- democracy, based on expectation that policies will have the effect promised, is undermined if the process is illusory

2 main conclusions:
*  Successful reforms need to recognise the `real world' of policy making
* Policy making needs to adapt to new challenges
- ``system stewardship'' would involve policy makers overseeing a knowingly adaptive process of formulation and delivery of policy outcomes, this has roles:
  - goals
  - rules
  - feedback
  - response

Policy fundamentals (fundamentals of good policy making which need to be observed at some point in the policy process):
* Clarity on goals
* Open and evidence-based idea generation
* Rigorous policy design
* Responsive external engagement
* Thorough appraisal
* Clarity on the role of central government and accountabilities
* Establishment of effective mechanisms for feedback and evaluation

These are put into reality by addressing:
* Structures
* Controls
* Politics
* Skills
* Culture

Recommendations
* The appointment within each department of a `Policy Director'
* An extension of existing Accounting Officer responsibilities to cover due policy process, based on the policy fundamentals
* Streamlined `policy assessments' to replace existing impact assessments and business cases
* A greater role for the centre in overseeing the quality of policy making (rather than just skills and capabilities) through the creation of a senior Head of Policy Effectiveness 

To address concerns (from both parties) about the relationships between civil servants and ministers:
* Greater clarity from ministers on their high-level policy goals; and greater clarity from ministers and civil service leaders on the value both parties can bring to the policy process
* Engaging ministers early in the policy process

To address needs when operating in decentralised world, new skills and behaviours:
* Better development of the skills of policy teams within departments, including more emphasis on policy design, innovation and influencing
* Changes to incentives to retain internal expertise and to make more use of external expertise in policy making.

Culture of the civil service needs to change (to ``system stewardship''):
* Whitehall policy makers need to reconceive their role increasingly as one of creating the conditions for others to deal with policy problems using innovative and adaptive approaches
* Incentives need to reward those who energetically search out experience and ideas, network, facilitate and understand the systems within which they operate

``policy makers argue that the specific impact tests simply rationalise decisions already taken'' (See National Audit Office, Assessing the Impact of Proposed New Policies, 2010, p.5; and Regulatory Policy Committee, Challenging Regulation, 2011)

``By policy design, we mean the stage in the process which turns policy ideas into implementable actions'' - emphasis here is on avoiding costs of bad policy by prototyping and stress-testing their ideas, and also by creating flexible designs that can be adapted by others p15},

Concepts, actors, processes (which are highly iterative) all covered these in detail, with examples from School Food and Mobile Streets missions. Examples peter out after prototypes, as demonstrators are not yet in place, I guess.

Alongside missions are key enablers or infrastructures which don't have such clear societal outcomes but can combine to help achieve goals. They are the bedrock with which we can build, but they are not the point.


`` Whilst AI is no doubt important to UK industry, it is an enabling `General Purpose Technology'. AI could be highly negative or positive tool, depending on how it is deployed. It is a means to an end, but not the end in itself. We do not build society in order to build AI. It is the other way around.''

portfolio of innovation activities balanced across both the `push' of traditional technology-led innovation processes with the `pull' of societal, behavioural, cultural, political, and social movement-led dynamics

n a reversal of some consider the mission-oriented innovation process to be, the Vinnova method has explored how to build consensus about what missions should be through collaboration, via co-design processes for networks of stakeholders, users, and citizens. The learning from these activities forms missions with purpose, legitimacy, and momentum, and builds a sense of what can be achieved within systems

Process puts participation first- progresssively build a sharper framing of the possibility, a realistic sense of
capabilities, a broader set of engagement, diverse forms of knowledge, tangible outcomes earlier

Deliberately contrasts with EU missions process to maximise learning

``A thoroughly systemic approach, led by the integrative practice of design, could force science, innovation and politics together'' p54

Overview of Vission Zero - initiative to reduce road deaths in Sweden started in late 1990s. Was largely focussed on engineering, it reduced deaths but it was argued this was mainly for drivers not vulnerable road users. It ignored the wider system, mental models or the moral issues around transport. Compared to Dutch case where Stop de Kindermoord led to a reduction in motor vehicles which is a much stronger way of reducing death and injury. p58-61

Also nice challenge of innovation as science mindset of the state society etc which considers that experts can ``think hard'' and draw up a roadmap to solving society's problems. References Donella Meadows' ``Humility of not knowing'' that the only way to find out how to act is to start to act. Argues that the critique of the committee-led model does not undercut expertise but that the most producting framing is needed for deep expertise - including the expertise of citizens p62-66

This leads into a discussion of design p66 onwards. 

Design principles:
1. grounded
2. tangible
3. upstream (e.g. prevention rather than cure)
4. integrated (vertical, horizontal, nested)
5. iterative
6. participative
7. adaptive
8. scalable

Systems have layers which need representation. For example there are shared cultures and capabilities; standards and guidelines; data, code and services; financing; policy; law

Doorst framework - Dorst2015

Prototyping principles:
1. outcomes - how are cored shared outcomes delivered or refined?
2. scale - initiate and nurture scaling (organisational, spatial)
3. level - indicate system elements 
4. data - create new strategic data
5. conditions - uncover, articulate and initiate necessary changes
6. capability - develop sckills, perspectives, culture
7. engagement - citizen-facing format
8. agility - adaptive strategy for delivery

  comment          = {After Stephan and Levin, 1992, adopts a psychologically rich notion of motivation to incorporate its extrinsic as well as intrinsic aspects. It employs the three concepts of `gold' (financial rewards), `ribbon' (reputation and career rewards) and `puzzle' (intrinsic satisfaction)

Builds a conceptual framework linking value orientations (from the most normative `traditional' - which is split to pure and pragmitic tranditional - through `hybrid' to `entrepreneurial) to motivation (from amotiviation, through extrinsive - ribbon and gold - to intrinsic - puzzle).

Merton suggested that scientists are motivated by ribbon, economists that they are motivated by gold.

36 individual interviews and an on-line questionnaire survey of 735 scientists from five major UK research universities. sample is oriented towards the elite academic researchers operating in an environment in which they have the options to make a meaningful choice between traditional Mertonian goals and those of commercial engagement

The main variables used in the quantitative analysis are derived from the questions concerning: (a) the nature of their involvement in different types of industrial links; (b) their value orientations towards academia-industry interface; and (c) the factors motivating them to engage with industry

Unfortunately, the full survey and interview questions don't seem to have been included, but there are elements.

Majority of the scientists are motivated by the traditional rewards of the `ribbon', using commercial activities as a means to generate resources for their research. Personal pecuniary gain, the `gold', although not irrelevant, is seen as important by a much smaller proportion of the scientists. More crucially, the intrinsic satisfaction derived from commercial engagement itself, as in puzzle-solving, emerges as a central motivation shared by many of the scientists

- The traditional scientists as `reluctant' commercializers: the `ribbon'
- The hybrid scientists as `strategic' commercializers: the `ribbon' and `puzzle'
- The entrepreneurial scientists as `committed' commercializers: the `gold' and `puzzle'

They are distinct from universities and enterprises but have close links with them, as well as with local, regional, and national governments.

Found clear differences in the perceptual templates used by expert and novice observers when interpreting hedge and ditch features in aerial scenes

Experts:
- made better use of binocular disparity cues
- priorities disparity over `dark is deep' luminance rule
- showed greater sensitivity to stereoscopic profiles
- less likely to adopt convention prior for lighting-from-above (attributed to photogrammetric experience with counter-conventional lighting conditions)

Novices:
- prioritised luminance cues over disparity
- had a larger group amplitude in their luminance classification image},

I've not read the whole it but it identifies ``at least three different `families' of values'', which are drawn from earlier work and drawn on in other works such as MadanA2022publicvalues:

Sigma: keep it lean and purposeful - success is frugality - failure is waste - currency is money and time - emphasis of control is output - low slack - fixed/single goals - costed, segmented information

Theta: keep it honest and fair - success is rectitude - failure is malversation - currency is trust and entitlements - emphasis of control is process - medium slack - incompatible `double bind' goals - structured information

Lambda: keep it robust and resilient - success is resilience - failure is catastrophe - currency is security and survival - emphasis of control is input/process - high slack - emergent/multiple goals - rich exchange, collective asset information

NPM is primarily Sigma-type values. It assumes a culture of public service honest as given. Further, NPM's focus on products and services within parameters and de-emphasis of externalities indicate that it is incompatible with safety.

It strikes me that this is based more of the desires and dreams of people working in robotics fields or government, rather than a paper on addressing the real needs of society(ies). That may be fine, but it expresses itself in the early pages (and in various summary paragraphs) as being about addressing what are known elsewhere as Grand Challenges. 

I like evidence, and so I wonder what is the hard evidence that robotics is essential to solving these challenges (in some cases, it could be detrimental, e.g. a switch to EVs could worsen environmental damage)?

I'm not implying that robotics, AI, cyber and smart can't be used in the solutions to Grand Challenges. However, I find myself increasingly worrying about the jostling for the limited of attention of policy- and decision-makers when we are at a global moment when we need to fully focus on solving problems that threaten the foundations of our societies. How do decision-makers, who are often not trained in science or tech, differentiate between the dreams of those invested an a technology, and real-world evidence?

Systems are not studied objectively ``a useful system perspective is sensitive to the fact that people hold various interpretations of situations, problems, and what can and ought to be done about them''

Outlines 4 systems perspectives along two axes:
1. hard versus soft/critical
2. organic versus designed

Also outlines 3 dimensions of a situation:
1. problem space - subjective interpretation and evaluation of whether a situation is troubling, and for whom (preferences, attention, preceptions, priorities, voice, expectations, resignation, vulnerabilities)
2. situation space - state of affairs of a system (jobs, crime, discrimination, literacy, polluction, health, hunger, addiction)
3. behavioural architecture -  those parts of systems that cause situations to be a certain way, 4 dimentions:
  - economic
  - cognitive
  - normative
  - power/politics

Hard system perspectives treat systems as real entities with defined boundaries that we can analyze objectively and improve with available knowledge and technologies to achieve uncontested objectives

Soft/critical system perspectives treat systems as ways of thinking and reflecting about subjective images that people hold about social situations and perceived problems, seeks to explore differences in purpose, power, and voice; in opinions about what constitutes an improvement; and in evaluating the appropriateness of solutions

Designed systems refer to entities that are configured instrumentally to serve a specific purpose

Organic systems refer to social agglomerates, people who occupy a social or geographical space and relate as a result of informal social and historical processes (e.g. families, communities, tribes, villages, and societies)

Sekem (SeelosM2018) is designed soft/critical and Gram Vikas (SeelosM2018) is organic soft/critical

system work requires that we get close to systems

adopting the system perspective outlined may be the reduction and elimination of some pathologies in the philanthropic sector - obsession with technical solutions, a sense of urgency to demonstrate large-scale impact, and the formulation of strategies with prespecified objectives designed by people who are not part of the target system},

All about ``principled negotiation'', which is neither hard nor soft and ultimate about being clear about all parties' interests

Negotiation should consider p10-1:
- people - separate people from the problem
- interests - focus on interests, not positions
- options - generate a variety of possiblities before deciding what to do
- criteria - insist that the result be based on some objecitve standard

Be specific about interests p28

Expand the pie of options before dividing it p31

Separate inventing options from judging them (gives practical suggestions for how this can be achieved such as ``daring brainstorming'') p33

Invent agreements of different strengths such as: p37-8
* substantive -- procedural
* permanent -- provisional
* comprehensive -- partial
* final -- in principle
* unconditional -- contingent
* binding -- nonbinding
* first-order -- second-order

Different interests can dovetail, leading to a solution p39

Public and non-profit research organisations include:
- Public Sector Research Establishments (PSREs)
- Research Council Institutes (RCIs)
- Medical Research Council (MRC) units
- Catapult centres
- Independent Research Organisations (IROs)
- private non-profit organisations, such as charities

``Pressures on applied R\&D budgets has meant that the available funding for research organisations has shifted away from longer-term core funding to shorter-term project-based funding''

``The UK devotes a significantly smaller amount of public funds to non-university R\&D compared to other countries''

Research functions:
- To perform research
- To innovate
- To gather and distribute scientific information
- To develop high-level skills
- Manage strategic risk
- Support the development of policy
- Underpin business and public sector operations
- Develop standards, test and regulate
- Provide and maintain infrastructure and specialist equipment
- Training and teaching (PhD students or apprenticeship training, but generally on  a smaller scale compared to universities)
- Stewardship of national collections (for example, core samples or artistic collections)},

  comment          = {A scathing review of works on the history of science policy followed by a nre version of the history from 1900 onwards

``The quality of the historical and policy discourse around science policy is notably lower than for say economic or defence policy''

``what `science policy' refers to is not stable ... professionals mean policy for scientific research, not all science: it is not about policy for scientific knowledge as a whole (which would include education). They mean policy for research, but not all research''

``science policy too often assumes that the UK is an island unto itself, that what applies to the whole world applies to the UK, that the UK is a little world in miniature''

The history of science policy is lost in long-gone ministries - historic reviews neglect this

The Haldane Principle was made up in the 1960s claiming to be from 1918 and part of the ``fanciful history of science policy'' - the claims of self-interested parties who have sought to promote science, and their science, by using stories of failure, indifference to science, and all the rest

``complaints about lack of R\&D funding peaked at the moment in British history when R\&D funding was at its highest as a proportion of GDP (the early 1960s)''

Claims of fourth industrial revolution, great transformations are ``not based on serious historical research, but rather propagandistic histories that are part of a claim for more public money'' [oof]

Disillusion in 1960s led to more scrutiny of research plans, creating more of a sense of the government as customer for research -  Rothschild Report (1971) - the customer-contractor principle, to bring research programmes under more control

`` The UK went from importing half its food to near self-sufficiency in the 1980s''

``From the late 1980s, a shift away from near-market research ... Departmental research and development was slashed along with the rationale for major state-led programmes. The entrepreneurial state (which did exist) was killed off. The research councils were not cut anything like as much''

White paper:  ``Realising our potential'' - talk of entrepreneurial universities, and spin-outs, and of course Silicon Valley. ``The paradox was that continuing government support was based on the idea that only research far from the market should be supported, and that this research would lead to new products and processes''

``Since the 1990s, research policy has been a substitute for industrial policy''},

- problems
- proposals
- politics

Only when these come together can decisions be made

Problem stream:
- ``getting people to see a condition as a problem is a central political accomplishment'' - problems are conditions that:
  - conflict with prevailing values
  - have be categorised in a particular way (the same conditions can be framed as different problems)

Proposal stream:
- Development of proposals must be done long before the opportunity fo action adoption
proposal are selected resembles natural selection, they must be:
  - technically feasible
  - acceptable, in terms of budget
  - acceptable, to the mass (or attentive) public

Political stream:
- Tremendously important and is down to changes in adminstration, shifts in partisan or ideological balance, interest group pressure, endogenous part of policymaking

Policy entrepreneurs:
- try to keep issues alive in good times and bad.
- advocate particular proposals and become active when they can attach this to a currently active problem
- Only if there is a predictable or unpredictable window of opportunity when the proposal matches an current problem and there is political will to consider the change
- self interest but also principle is required to arrive at position

From KernR2018, referring more to Beland and Howlett 2016, the window of opportunity in the problem stream or politics stream become focussing events that allow conditions to be framed for their policy solution.

Critical to this is the argumentation, persuasion, marshalling evidence that sets the agenda

``of all the attributes of successful policy entrepreneurs, sheer persistence is probably the most important''

Also discusses the role that social scientsts could play in this
1. they can support the recognition of problems by documenting the condition - but have less special expertise for judging how inappropriate or intolerable a condition is
2. they can supply information about how the world works - but need to robust to not threaten the credibility of the field (and tentitiveness is exactly what the political system does not tolerate very well)
3. they can be involved in generating policy proposals and even gradually reorientate the perspectives from which people think

Some favourite quotes:
- tremendous flurry of activity p41
- look for problems to which to hook their solutions p41
- Getting people to see a condition as a problem is a central political accomplishment p42
- ``policy primeval soup'' p43
- Proposals will always be bent around to suit the purposes of various decision makers p47},

1. define the problem - policy framing - important problems are less clearly defined
2. develop the dimensions that characterise the problem - labelling - will determine what part of government it sit with but its the policy subfield that determines the social regulatory label

``even over-specifying their nature so that some future reduction of these attributes can simplify the problem for both the analyst and the practical policy maker''

Characteristics (variables) of policy problems (first 3 relate to problems themselves, last 4 are about the connection between problem characteristics and instrument choice):
1. Solubility - in reality programs and instruments are oversold to have opportunity for adoption - problems can be acute or chronic (lots of reasons given for being chronic - i.e. are never solved despite different instruments)
2. Complexity
  - Political complexity - number of political interests and actors involved in the problem
  - Programmatic complexity (may be inversely related to political complexity): problems with different requirements for citizens' knowledge; competing models of causation
3. The question of scale - can it be disaggregated? 
4. Divisibility - can the solutions be divided up (e.g. public, private)
5. Monetarization - can it be addressed by simply spending money?
6. Scope of activity - the types of instruments and the capacity of governments to apply these
7. Interdependencies - one or more policy domains (which takes us back round to problem framing)

Assumptions of CBA include:
- Marginality - the change won't affect prices, the existence of goods, relationships between economic vaiables, the rules of economic behaviours, etc
- Homogeneity - the actors, their interests and the dimensions of the policy outcomes are not particularly varied
- Certainty - parameters and outcomes are sufficiently well-known

Instead, ROA considers:
- uncertainty - all significant risks and opportunities
- diversity - all the different dimensions and metrics (not trying to aggregate to onw metric which requires subjective judgement)
- disequilibrium - a dynamic assessment of the direction, rate and magnitude of change in the economy

Sets out that:
- market failure is a specific application of market shaping
- CBA is a specific application of ROA
- equilibrium is one of the many possible states of dynamic systems that can be explained by complexity

Provide more details of the steps of ROA - which I would (probably naively) summarise as systems mapping and analysis

Outlines the key differences between CBA and ROA, in terms of dimensions, input scope, focus, output scope, directionality and threshold of viability

Considers problems of non-marginal change and discusses them in terms of disequilibrium, uncertainty and diversity:
- climate change minigation and low-carbon innocation
- policy for preparing for and responding to a pandemic
- regional development and `levelling up''

Illustrates how CBA and ROA arrive at different conclusions when considering policy options for replacing coal. Using CBA, Frank (2014) found that gas was the best alternative, followed by hydroelectric and nuclear, with wind and solar last. ROA would have considered much more around the energy system, including opportunties for structural change, the reductions in costs due to learning-by-doing, economies of scale and development of complementary technologies.

``An ROA might be more qualified in its conclusions [than was Frank's (2014) CBA], as it would recognise the inherent subjectivity in the relative weighting given to each potential outcome in their different dimensions. However, it is not difficult to see how an ROA could come to a different conclusion to that of the CBA in this case. On the dimension of electricity costs alone, the ROA might conclude that support for solar power was the most cost-effective option; wind the second, and gas the least''},

``Projectised logic'' and incremental innovation meant activities did not fit with complex, systemic nature of challenges we are facing

Instead wanted an approach that would:
- help see bigger picture
- with with leverage points across existing silos
- prioritise social/collective learning
- explore evolutionary potential
- collectively reimagine development

Inspired by Climate-KIC - UNDP's Strategic Plan

Many other organisations on similar journey, realising that traditional linear approaches such as Logical Frameworks and picking a single winning technology

The three things they learned are:
1. The transformation is not just in the way the work was done but in the organisation and mindset. Required reflection and sense making over fragmented projects. ``Small islands of coherence'' to learn and advocate for systemic changes in the organisation and develop a new business model for UNDP
2. Important to work on the horizontals as well as the verticals - finance, procurement, HR etc
3. Taking a systemic view of UNDP enmeshed in multiple institutional dynamics, internal voice casting doubt on new ideas is self reinforcing, instead being the system in the room and test alternatives

Challenge to be the most helpful person in the room, engaging with different core functions across the organisation

The ACF grew up in an era when the analysis of policy change focused on the battle between interest groups, with government regarded as one interest among many (Richardson 1999)

Eschews analysing policy through stages such as agenda setting, policy formation and implementation - through their interplay people can be persuaded to change their minds - battle of ideas

Empirical evidence from multiple case studies, surveys and interviews

Policy created within relatively closed policy communities ``policy sub-systems'' - public servants and politicians, organized pressure groups, firms, trade unions, journalists, academics and, at times, concerned citizens

Beliefs are the fundamental elements driving policy - information is important, journalists key transmitters - material interests less important - coalitions form where beleifs converge or overlap

Policy change needs to be examined over long periods of time at least 10 years' data

The heart of the framework is its model of beliefs that is based on, or inspired by, Lakatos's (1978) account of scientific belief systems. Human belief systems have 3 elements:
- core beliefs
  - deep core beliefs - strongly held and stable (e.g. ideology)
  - policy core beliefs - relatively stable (e.g. policy implementation assumptions, role of state)
- secondary or peripheral beliefs - change over time (e.g. funding, delivery, implementation specifics)

Problems:
1. little attention to framing however environment may be interpretated by beliefs - manner in which people take in information and assess evidence is affected by their core beliefs - which makes compromise across groups with diverse core beliefs impossible because perception of empirical evidence differs
2. concentration on conscious beliefs when it is likely that core beliefs are not always known
3. or are misperceived so surveys alone should be used with care, measure through behaviour

Discusses the hypotheses that arise out of this framework and how there is not much empirical evidence for them [but they make some intuitive sense], although stark exceptions can be found

nice antidote to approaches that concentrate upon material self-interest and bargaining driving all policy ... [but] belief-driven hypotheses of the ACF seem trivial when exposed to critical analysis},

``Cost overruns are highly inaccurate and biased for public investments, ranging from an average cost overrun for roads of 24 percent to dams at 85 percent, in real terms''

Benefit shortfall are not as great, and sometimes don't exist, but there is no symmetry (benefit gains do not balance benefit shortfalls)

Lots of statistics and measures of significance and shape (kurtosis) of distribution

``We define the cost-benefit fallacy as the situation where individuals behave as if cost-benefit estimates are largely accurate and unbiased, when in fact they are highly inaccurate and biased''

``The root cause of cost overrun, according to behavioral science, is the well-documented fact that planners and managers keep underestimating the importance of schedules, geology, market prices, scope changes, and complexity in investment after investment''

For cost-benefit analysis to become useful in public investment policy and planning, the following needs to happen:
1. Systematic and effective de-biasing of cost-benefit forecasts - suggest using Kahneman ``outside view'' to create a method for debiasing public investments (and quotes from Kahneman2011)
2. Introduction of skin-in-the-game for cost-benefit forecasters - institutional setups that reward forecasters who get their estimates right and punish those who do not
3. Independent audits of cost-benefit forecasts - monitor effectiveness of the above two approaches and adjust if they are not working or for unintended consequences
4. Adaption of cost-benefit forecasting to the messy, non-expert character of democratic decision making - ``Nobody in their right mind would argue that expert input, science, and cost-benefit analysis are undesirable in deciding which policies and investments to pursue in a society. But, similarly, no one in their right mind would depend on only experts in making such decisions, especially when we know that experts are subject to the cost-benefit fallacy and produce, over and over, the kind of biased cost-benefit analyses documented above''},

Nice simple paper with a clear goal, useful to return to for using their framework in the consideration of AI work and also for refs in the field of responsible AI

The United Nations Coalition for Digital Environmental Sustainability (CODES) highlights Systems Thinking as a tool in a required in the first of three phases in a shift towards a sustainable planet in the digital age

Two key challenges:
1. how to work across disciplinary-based paradigms to effect positive change - the discourse for addressing AI problems is predominantly anchored in a disciplinary perspective (e.g. computer science and engineering -  even Responsible AI researchers and practitioners tend to approach the topic from a narrowly disciplinary perspective and develop solutions based on their own epistemological strategies
2. how to take a holistic view of the problem and solution space - current body of literature does not adequately provide practical guidance taking a whole of systems view - literature also lacks a conceptual framework, or theoretical foundation, that allows to conceptualize, identify and evaluate the `effectiveness' of interventions for Responsible AI in a structured way

Present the ``Five Ps'' framework, which has Problem to response for all four leverage zones (increasing magnitudes of `leverage', from smallest to largest, each having 3 of Meadows' 12 leverage points):
- Parameter - reaction - tweaking algorithms and modifying models' parameters (short term fix / tweak)
- Process - conform (incremental change) - changing the societal and technical processes and feedback (adjust / adapt)
- Pathway - reform (transitional change) - defining the system design and structure that govern processes and parameters (restructure / redesign)
- Purpose - transformation (radical change) - changing intent, mental models and paradigms (repurpose / reframe / redefine)

Gives examples in each zone (and considers each's potential to change the paradigm under which the platform operates, within a firm):
- parameters - address bias, fixing design flaws, technological solutionism
- process - promoting diversity and inclusion in development teams, training opportunities, questioning assumptions
- pathway - governance structures, collective partnerships
- purpose - fundamental change in purpose of the work and the goal of the system


Questions that remain open:
- Parameters - how to coordinate and measure parameters that have an impact on Responsible AI, such as fairness, bias and accountability, across system and disciplinary boundaries
- Process - how to enable efforts that enhance Responsible AI principles and mitigate unintended consequences, encouraging coordination of the effectiveness and efficiency of initiatives
- Pathway - the notion of accountability and ownership of responsibility, including ensuring that structures evolve collaboratively with respect to advances in technology and changing societal expectations
- Purpose - how to align multiple stakeholders with multiple perspectives to common goals in relation to Responsible AI, and how these goals interact and evolve with other paradigms that emerge},

``shifting to rule by aesthetics and efficiency than through rights and entitlements; basing urban citizenship on ownership of land and property as a private good than a right to the commons; and turning the problem of unequal access to urban services as a technological concern than a structural problem of poverty and exclusion''

``The [Smart Cities Mission] SCM rests on these neoliberal elite power structures in urban India. However, it also departs in ``who makes up these elite coalitions'' and ``how they operate''. For one, the SCM's obsession with ``speed'' or ``fast urbanism'' (Datta, 2015) takes digital technology as the path to speeding up India's urban future. Elsewhere, Rob Kitchin (2014) describes this ``data revolution'' as a faith in the speed and efficiency of the data offered by the private sector to install checks against the practices of a corrupt state. In India, this has produced a whole gamut of ``data elites'' - IT firms like IBM, Infosys and Cisco, consulting firms like Arup, AECOM, Deloitte, Mckinsey, KPMG and Knight Frank who privately hold public data. When the Smart Cities challenge was launched, data elites held the reins for municipal governments to design urban proposals. Previously, the Government of India used the Department of Statistics to model scenarios for India's urban future. But now these functions have been transferred to the private sector. Even though data is privately held, most middle classes see IT sector as morally superior and more transparent than the government''

uncover the constituent elements of the SC discourse coalition by analysing the text and talk of three sections of elites: the Indian Government under the leadership of Narendra Modi (2015 onwards), the group of private companies that I call as IT consulting firms for their role in promoting digital technology as an urban solution in India and finally, the resident welfare associations (RWAs) that represent urban middle classes

Common themes between 3 discourses:
- negative assessment of urban government
- mis-recognition of the poor
- urban informal settlements are dismissed

There are also differences that suggest competing interests between elites, which will slow down or worse stall some Smart Cities projects as we have seen before in India's elite urban projects},

Really interesting and worth returning to if I am studying political discourse as it suggests how to study the language used and how this changes and affects coalitions

``discourse is defined here as an ensemble of ideas, concepts, and categories through which meaning is given to social and physical phenomena, and which is produced and reproduced through an identifiable set of practices''

Crucial to also examine those instances in which some contributions are ruled is - institutional discourse constructs the problem in a particular way

Metaphors are used [I think these are like short hand] - ``acid rain'' is the example

Story lines form a narrative: people convey facts in story form, condensed narrative, assuming a more complex narrative is available to the mind if the receiver, but the assumption of mutual understanding may be false

Discourse coalition share use of a particular set of story lines

Assessing influence of story lines allows power and dominance to be analysed. As story lines begin to dominate there is discourse structuration, ultimately when it becomes dominant and solidified into his institutions operate there is discourse institutionalisation

Example of air pollution which was originally an urban problem (smog) and this way of seeing it had to be broken for it to be understood as a rural problem (acid rain)

An emblem has a central role in facilitating much more than a change in policy it can bring about conceptual shift

Gives 10 steps for undertaking the analysis

Identified the emergence of two discourses around acid rain: 
- traditional pragmatism - problem was not with UK which has proud record of pollution abatement
- ecological modernisation - UK is dirty old man of Europe, proud record is anachronism

Uses the behaviour of water, made up of molecules, as an analogy

``the economy is far less predictable than the weather, given human agency, as Hayekian economists justifiably argue''

Suggests modelling starting from the must rudimentary:
- employment rate
- percentage share of wages
- debt to GDP
- 9 parameters

  abstract         = {The Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) is the UK policy instrument for pre-commercial procurement, and the UK Government's flagship policy on innovation-oriented public procurement. Its high potential for instigating commercially relevant R\&D that addresses challenges facing the UK public sector, and for supporting the growth of innovative small firms has been stressed in policy and academic circles alike. Existing evidence, however, suggests that its full potential has yet to be realised. The SBRI scheme is currently under review to identify ways to scale it up and improve its effectiveness. Against this background, the aim of this research is to empirically examines the perceived role and effectiveness of the SBRI scheme in stimulating R\&D and innovation, and any related challenges that impede the alignment of relevant policy aims with procurement processes and practices as executed ``on the ground''. The study employed a qualitative research design comprising 26 in-depth interviews and collection and analysis of more than 70 relevant documents. The semi-structured interviews allowed developing an in-depth understanding of the perceptions of key relevant stakeholders: small firms participating in SBRI competitions and supplying R\&D services, public organisations using the SBRI scheme and policy makers and innovation experts. As compared to the focus of the existing literature on evaluating the outputs and impact of the SBRI scheme against the provided inputs, this research report emphasises process-related, institutional, organisational and behavioural aspects which influence SBRI implementation and policy enactment more broadly.},
  comment          = {Nice comparison of the difference between public and private sector settings in table 1

recommends:
1. a better understanding of the nature of innovation procurement capabilities and the processes, structures and mechanisms underpinning their development or lack thereof
2. further research on systems of measuring the performance and impact of innovation-oriented public procurement, in close collaboration with policy makers, followed by demonstration and pilot implementation projects to test effectiveness, appropriate measures and targets
3. future research should also address cultural aspects of organising and managing innovation procurement projects in public sector settings, e.g. mind sets and perceptions of innovation procurement by different stakeholders, how their interests of could be aligned e.g. through positive incentive systems and alignment of strategies
4. the role of government procurement in creating new markets, understand better how exactly public procurement projects can help to create new markets and what are the key mechanisms and processes underlying this aim},

Transformative technologies (TTs) refer to technological advances with a high likelihood of significantly altering society

The outcome of TT development, at least in the initial stages, are liable to be determined by a small proportion of those people and the institutions that house them, based on a fairly narrow set of priors and assumptions

Resulting governance models have fallen prey to the transformative technology trilemma. Coalescing camps implicitly or explicitly assume the need to accept significant trade-offs between progress (advancing technological capabilities), participation (enabling public input and self-determination), and safety (avoiding disproportionate risks). This reliably leads to a set of three failure modes:
1. Capitalist Acceleration: Sacrificing safety for progress while maintaining basic participation - e.g. lots of startup and consumer choice
2. Authoritarian Technocracy: Sacrificing participation for safety while maintaining basic progress - e.g. entrusting only a few entities with the ability to develop advanced technologies and implementing monitoring, regulation, and calculation
3. Shared Stagnation: Sacrificing progress for participation while maintaining basic safety - anti-technology with greater forms of direct democracy and local production and decision-making

Propose to find a fourth path, by developing a plurality of CI systems that encompass all three goals: participation, safety, and progress},

  abstract         = {Environmental research varies in its methodological quality, degree of bias, and relevance to policy questions. Using this heterogeneous, and sometimes polarised, research to inform environmental policies can be challenging. Policy-making in the healthcare field sometimes uses systematic reviews (SRs) to tackle these issues and present a comprehensive, policy-neutral, transparent and reproducible synthesis of the evidence. However, there is less familiarity with SRs in the environmental field. The aim of this article is to: (1) summarise the process of conducting SRs, using best practice methods from the healthcare field as an example, (2) explain the rationale behind each stage of conducting a SR, and (3) examine the prospects and challenges of using SRs to inform environmental policy. We conclude that existing SR protocols from healthcare can be, and have been, applied successfully to environmental research but some adaptations could improve the process. The literature search stage could be expedited by standardising the reporting and indexing of environmental studies, equivalent to that in the healthcare field. The consistency of the study appraisal stage of SRs could be augmented by refining the existing quality assessment tools used in the healthcare field, enhancing their ability to discriminate quality and risk of bias in non-randomised studies. Ultimately, the strength of evidence within SRs on environmental topics could be improved through more widespread use of randomised controlled trials as a research method, owing to their inherently lower risk of bias when conducted according to best practice.},

OpenAI rigidly adhere's to charter as well as working closely in the same location, long hours, social time together. Philosophy of effective altruism

Pay structure reflects how much of the charter has been absorbed

On transparency:
Didn't release GPT-2 because it was dangerous - and therefore accussed of overhyping

``OpenAI insisted that GPT-2 hadn't been a stunt. It was, rather, a carefully thought-out experiment, agreed on after a series of internal discussions and debates. The consensus was that even if it had been slight overkill this time, the action would set a precedent for handling more dangerous research''

But also people felt that OpenAI was once again walking back its earlier promises of openness and transparency. Also kept findings that scaling current technologies would be the best approach to achieving AGI secret for 6 months because this was considered their main competitive advantage.

Strategy is twofold:

A fantastic summary and critical review of each of the theories, as well as references to how they've been applied and how they've been developed since first proposed. After the review of the theories, discusses how they can be applied as well as identifying two gaps in the theory as applied to transition studies. I've read this twice - see all my underlines in my reMarkable copy!

Many of the frameworks focus on coalitions but have different perspectives on what is the ``glue'' that holds them together.

Also links several with Geels multi layer perspective (MLP)

Theories:
- Advocacy coalitions framework (ACF, Sabatier and colleagues) - within a given policy subsystem, defined as including all actors which regularly participate in policy formulation processes in a given policy field, there are several advocacy coalitions (consensus is around beliefs), consisting of public and private actors, which are competing for influence on policymaking, one coalition is often dominant. Policy change comes from policy learning, negotiation, external and internal shocks in the subsystem, and macro-features such as f linked sub-systems, public opinion, and policymaking venues
- Multiple streams approach (MSA, Kingdon, Zahariadis) - three streams in policy systems (problems, policy/solutions, and politics), window of opportunity, policy entrepreneur, solutions chase problems, policy dynamics over time (see Kingdon1993), Howlett 2016 add process and programme stream to include policy implementation 
- Punctuated equilibrium theory (PET, Baumgartner, mentioned in WeimerV2015), a dynamic between the politics of subsystems and the macro politics of Congress and the Presidency, thereby normally militating against change but sometimes reinforcing it, policymakers are boundedly rational
- Discourse coalitions (DC, Hajer2005) - a rich diversity of  approaches that focus on narratives, discourses, or frames, actors define issues through shared discourses influences their recognition as public policy problem and the subsequent policy response, story lines, best story, does not consider institutional context and so other work has extended DC, including Arts 2006  discourses, actors, power and rules, Smith and Kern 2009 `` argued that a coalition of policymakers, academics and consultants co-developed a powerful transitions storyline with sufficient interpretive flexibility to appear attractive and non-threatening for policymakers and businesses''
- Policy feedback theory (PFT, Pierson) - ``[the creation of new policies] occurs in a context that is deeply influenced by already existing policies'', feedbacks are resource effects and interpretative effects

2 generic shortcomings:
- largely neglected to explicitly address messy, real-world policy mixes
- studies rarely consider the impact of policy processes and policy outputs on sociotechnical change

Grand challenges need to go beyond policy mixes and consider their interactions},

AI is a marketing term ``it's a way to may certain kinds of automation sound sophisticated, powerful or magical .. to dodge accountability to make machines sound like autonomous thinking entities, rather than tools that a re created and used by people and companies''

Even the term used for the field was originally a marketing term in 1950s.

Replace the word AI with automation then ask:
- What is being automated? 
- By whom and why? 
- Who benefits?
- Who is being harmed?
- How well does it work? 
- Who is accountable?
- What laws/regulations apply to what is being automated?

- makes the tech look powerful and valuable
- distracts from the real issues

Four pillars based around elements of pipeline (this may be linear, loop back, or have multiple pipelines to form a system):
- Data collection
- Training processes
- Model evaluation and analysis
- System deployment

Each pillar affects rights and should give rise to regulatory artifacts.

Rights:
- human
- civil
- cultural

right to freedom and right to equal opportunity handle the current harms or short-term risk

Gaps between the design and operation of algorithms and our understanding of their ethical implications can have severe consequences affecting individuals as well as groups and whole societies. This paper makes three contributions to clarify the ethical importance of algorithmic mediation. It provides a prescriptive map to organise the debate.

  abstract         = {Ethics and safety are two distinct concepts, although they can sometimes intersect.

Ethics refers to a set of moral principles or values that guide individuals or groups in determining what is right or wrong, good or bad. It involves making decisions based on principles such as honesty, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Ethical considerations often involve evaluating the impact of actions on others, the environment, and society as a whole.

On the other hand, safety pertains to the condition of being protected from harm, danger, or risk. It involves taking precautions and measures to prevent accidents, injuries, or any form of harm to individuals, property, or the environment.

While ethics and safety can overlap, they are not synonymous. Safety measures are often put in place to protect individuals and the environment, regardless of ethical considerations. However, ethical considerations can influence safety practices by emphasizing the importance of protecting all stakeholders and minimizing harm.

It's important to note that ethical behavior can contribute to a safer environment by promoting responsible decision-making and considering the well-being of all involved.},

- The government will use its convening power to establish an AI Council of leading figures from industry and academia with ministerial representation. The Council will drive action, oversee implementation of the deal, galvanise industry, and advise government.
- The government will establish a new Office for Artificial Intelligence to work with the AI Council to create and deliver the AI strategy, and collaborate with other relevant initiatives, such as the GovTech Catalyst.

Leadership, policy setting and strategy:
- Senior figures from industry and academia will participate in the AI Council to provide high level leadership and momentum for the implementation of AI review recommendations and the Sector Deal.

In the UK, policy makers are looking to large language models and other so-called foundation models as ways to potentially improve economic productivity

This policy brief outlines which policy levers could support those goals.

UK should pursue becoming a global leader in applying generative AI to the economy. Rather than use public support for building new foundation models, the UK could support the growing ecosystem of startups that develop new applications for these models, creating new products and services.

A UK approach to generative AI could leverage the existing national strengths in safe, responsible and ethical AI to put human safety and flourishing at the forefront of innovation. A national approach could achieve these goals by increasing understanding of and access to generative AI tools throughout the economy and society.

This policy brief answers three key questions:
- What policy infrastructure and social capacity does the UK need to lead and manage deployment of responsible generative AI (over the long term)?
- What national capability does the UK need for large-scale AI systems in the short- and medium-term?
- What governance capacity does the UK need to deal with fast moving technologies, in which large uncertainties are a feature, not a bug?},

- stakeholder and public engagement

Pre-summit engagement:
To ensure the widest range of domestic voices were heard, we partnered with the Royal Society, the British Academy, techUK, The Alan Turing Institute, the Founders Forum, and the British Standards Institution, as part of an ambitious and truly inclusive public dialogue to inform global action. A wide range of further events were also held including a business roundtable with CEOs and senior leaders from firms in a variety of sectors that develop and/or use AI, and roundtables with venture capital firms and think tanks, recognising the impact of AI is already present across our economy and society. Ministers from DSIT and other government departments have been present at a majority of the 24 events that will have been held, engaging with representatives from media, business, charity, and research sectors on top of ministers meeting with businesses and community groups. This has provided stakeholders with an opportunity to feed in their views on key themes to enrich Summit conversation and has underlined our commitment to a continued conversation before and after the Summit.

The summary of significant views from a plurality of participants:
- Unlocking the opportunities of AI
- Understanding potential societal risks
- International leadership and collaboration
- A role for regulation on AI

Kinda dismisses what is raised at the pre-summit events with

``Government has already sought to address some of the key issues raised through these engagements. The AI Safety Summit primarily intends to focus on the risks of frontier AI and discuss how they can be mitigated through internationally coordinated action''},

It focuses on foundation models, or general-purpose models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks:
* Safety: Developers must notify the government when they train a model whose processing budget exceeds 1026 integer or floating-point operations, which corresponds roughly to 1 trillion parameters, with a lower limit for training on biological sequences. (These are preliminary values to be updated regularly.) In addition, developers must watermark generated outputs and share results of safety tests conducted by so-called red teams.
* Privacy: The federal government will support tools to protect users' privacy and evaluate AI developers' collection of personal information. The order calls on Congress to pass comprehensive data-privacy legislation, reflecting the president's limited power in this area.
* Civil rights: Federal administrators of benefits, contractors, and landlords are barred from using algorithms to discriminate against members of protected groups. The Department of Justice and civil rights offices of various government agencies will set best practices for the use of AI in criminal justice and civil rights investigations.
* Competitiveness: A new National AI Research Resource will support researchers with processing power, data, tools, and expertise. The Federal Trade Commission will assist small business owners in commercializing AI developments. Immigration authorities will lower barriers to workers with expertise in critical areas like software engineering.
* Global leadership: The administration will work with other countries and nongovernmental organizations to set international standards for safety and risk management as well as an agenda for applying AI to solve global problems.},

Fears that `the robots are coming to take away our jobs' are an understandable reason for workers to reject robots, according to Norman Tebbit, Secretary of State for Employment. Speaking at a recent gathering of the West Midlands Engineering Employers Association, Mr Tebbit quipped that attempts to resist the coming of the robot were simply mechanical responses of the kind a robot would make! ``The greatest advantage workers have over robots,'' he said, ``is that they have minds. And when they think about the proposition of taking on new technology, they must see that jobs can only be made secure if the company they work for keeps its place in the markets.'' Mr Tebbit added that the attitude that robots breed mass unemployment is rubbish, and is no more relevant than it was in the last century, when worried Luddites smashed machinery. This attitude, he said, ignores the reality of the present day, where, taking Japan as an example, adopting new technology can lead to very low rates of unemployment. "It is not change which threatens jobs,'' he said, ``it is the refusal to change which costs jobs, as we have seen so often and so tragically in this country. ``Robots offer us a future of great prosperity and greater fulfilment than ever before. The only fear we have to face is a fear founded by ignorance. There is no security in opposing change.''},

builds on the UK's strengths but also represents the start of a step-change for AI in the UK, recognising the power of AI to increase resilience, productivity, growth and innovation across the private and public sectors. 

3 pillars, 3rd is governance. 
Aims to: 
- Invest and plan for the long-term needs of the AI ecosystem to continue our leadership as a science and AI superpower; 
- Support the transition to an AI-enabled economy, capturing the benefits of innovation in the UK, and ensuring AI benefits all sectors and regions; 
- Ensure the UK gets the national and international governance of AI technologies right to encourage innovation, investment, and protect the public and our fundamental values. 

- Establish medium and long term horizon scanning functions to increase government's awareness of AI safety. 
- Work with The Alan Turing Institute to update guidance on AI ethics and safety in the public sector. 
- Work with national security, defence, and leading researchers to understand what public sector actions can safely advance AI and mitigate catastrophic risks. 

``While the emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may seem like a science fiction concept, concern about AI safety and non-human-aligned systems is by no means restricted to the fringes of the field'' [referencing Stuart Russell, Allan Dafoe, Nick Bostrom].},

The CMA, FCA, ICO and Ofcom collectively believe that we can, and should, play a role in identifying and mitigating these risks within the industries we regulate

harms can occur both intentionally and inadvertently. those procuring and/or using algorithms often know little about their origins and limitations

there is a lack of visibility and transparency in algorithmic processing, which can undermine accountability

a ``human in the loop'' is not a foolproof safeguard against harms

In other quarters, these issues are ignored or considered science fiction. We wanted to clarify what the distribution of opinions actually is, what probability the best experts currently assign to high--level machine intelligence coming up within a particular time--frame, which risks they see with that development, and how fast they see these developing. We thus designed a brief questionnaire and distributed it to four groups of experts in 2012/2013. The median estimate of respondents was for a one in two chance that high-level machine intelligence will be developed around 2040--2050, rising to a nine in ten chance by 2075. Experts expect that systems will move on to superintelligence in less than 30 years thereafter. They estimate the chance is about one in three that this development turns out to be `bad' or `extremely bad' for humanity.},

If a superior alien civilization sent us a text message saying, ``We'll arrive in a few decades,'' would we just reply, ``OK, call us when you get here -- we'll leave the lights on''? Probably not -- but this is more or less what is happening with AI. Although we are facing potentially the best or worst thing ever to happen to humanity, little serious research is devoted to these issues outside small non-profit institutes such as the Cambridge Center for Existential Risk, the Future of Humanity Institute, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, and the Future of Life Institute. All of us -- not only scientists, industrialists and generals -- should ask ourselves what can we do now to improve the chances of reaping the benefits and avoiding the risks''},

Framing as a crisis:
Widespread use of emotive labels and dislocation of domination discussions

Frame contests - crisis narrative

Frames:
- Type 1: no crisis; political stance: no blame; policy stance: BAU
- Type 2: crisis as threat; political stance: diffuse blame; policy stance: defend status quo
- Type 3: crisis as opportunity; political stance: focus blame; policy stance: attack status quo

1. The first framing contest: ripple or crisis? - significance of events
proponents of type-1 frames argue to minimize event significance, proponents of type-2 frames are more likely to acknowledge event significance, and proponents of type-3 frames are most likely to maximize event significance

2. The second framing contest: incident or symptom? - causality, endogenize or exogenize accountability

Crisis exploitation - polical and policy blame `games'

Demonstrate that crisis exploitation strategies matter. However they may not be enough.

Incumbents are more likely to successfully survive the political game of crisis exploitation if:
a. they have good pre-crisis political capital
b. they communicate their crisis frames well
c. they haven't been in office long
d. the predominant view is that the crisis has exogenous causes
e. they have an `expert' commission as the main locus for official inquiry into the crisis

Oppositional forces are more likely to gain the upper hand if:
a. the predominant view is that the crisis has endogenous causes
b. incumbents have been in office a long time
c. incumbents have recently been getting bad press
d. opposition manages to instigate or capitalise on a political (non-expert) inquiry

Study finds that it is doubtful that crises are sufficient conditions for change},

Regulatory systems are not created overnight, and it would be unrealistic to expect the AI Safety Summit to address every angle of the AI governance question. But it would be equally unrealistic to suggest that a narrow conversation centred solely on technical mitigations for misuse and loss-of-control risks from a subset of AI systems is adequate to the challenges of the present moment. This week is an important opportunity to reassure people that, as AI assumes a greater role in their lives, it will be governed in the ways that we expect from other infrastructural technologies, and to set out a roadmap to that governance.},

  comment          = {Really interesting well-written paper reviewing work into participatory design in AI. Considers different approaches and develops a framework for analysis of approaches to AI design from literature and interviews.

Approaches to stakeholder participation:
- User-centered design (UCD)
- Service design
- Participatory design (PD)
- Co-design
- Value-sensitive design (VSD)
- Participatory action research (PAR)
- Social choice theory (SCT) and mechanism design
- Participatory democracy and civic participation
- Deliberation theory

Really useful for descriptions of these methods. Summary critique is that all are limited in particular because none are fully participatory, tending to have some information, direction, power or other factor that is not perfectly shared.

Full stakeholder empowerment only achieved in stakeholders have ability to make decisions about both: p4
- design
- process

Identify parameters of participation:
- Dimensions:
  - Goal - why is participation needed - can be instrumentalist (e.g. ``better results'', whatever better means) or normative (e.g. its the right thing to do)
  - Scope - what is on the table AND who is involved
  - Form - what form does the participation take (ranking, dialog, learning, ...)
- Modes (variation on framework in PatelPPBPS2021, but more about how these shape participation rather than them being of increasing level of participation):
  - consult
  - include
  - collaborate
  - own

Deliberation theory argues that people learn new information and update their beliefs all the time and some methods do not take account of this

Findings:
- The majority of projects operationalized stakeholder participation via discrete preference or value elicitation
- Researchers and practitioners feel they have to substantially scale back their participatory ambitions
- instead of directly engaging the affected stakeholders, AI system designers
have come to embrace a proxy-based approach to participation (representatives, UX/HCI practitioners, or algorithmic proxies) which have risks of:
  - mistaken identify
  - biased intermediation
  - stale modelling

Unique challenges for participation in AI:
- High-Dimensionality v. Human Reasoning
- Scaling v Caring},

The drive to formal organisation has blunted movements because it has driven organisers to search for resources to maintain the organisation which drives them towards elites.

Idea that if movement becomes part of the establishment it has lost (c.f. RochonM1993)

Power - may be devine - on in capitalist societies: ``not legitimated by rendering the powerful devine but by obscuring their existence''

In 1960s idea that pluralist apporach with electoral representatives does not distribute power as many are barred from participation and entrapped by predetermined electoral ``choices''. Protest may be the only recourse. However, it is also not a matter of free choice, and is not available to lower class groups at all.

The study of movements, but focussing on organisations, which must have leadership, a constitution, a legislative programme, diverts attention from many other forms of political unrest e.g. truancy, worker absenteeism, rent defaults.},

Social movement success may be:

- process change
- values change

Political leaders may concede such process change to defuse protest whilst limiting policy change, diffuse responsibility for policy and/or to help monitor bureaucratic performance

Draws on a study by Gamson of 53 ``challenging groups''. Only 20 percent achieved policy change without acceptance of the group, the rest achieved both, neither or process change only. Gamson called this co-optation

- dissimulation
- false-compliance
- pilfering
- feigned ignorance
- slander
- arson
- sabotage

Require little or no co-ordination, appear individual but are not performed in isolation and without others knowing or suspecting. They also represent a form a self-help. As such, this paper challenges the idea that resistance requires some form of sacrefice. The distinction between `self-indulgent' and `principled' is naive.

Perpetrators rarely want to draw attention to themselves - but also neither do officials or those being resisted against, which means it is often not on the historical record
